# Tangle
This is the documentation page for _Tangle_, _Twine_’s compiler. Because _Twine_ is geared towards symbolic manipulation, Part I of this documentation covers the mathematical background necessary for understanding _Tangle_’s architecture and implementation details. Part II provides an overview of the compiler’s API and implementation details. Part IV – _finale_ – presents current limitations and plans for future improvements.

This part introduces the basic mathematical background necessary to understanding this documentation’s exposition. Readers familiar with the outlined topics should skip to the Part II.

## Logic
The following symbols are used extensively throughout the documentation.

| Symbol      | Semantic                 | Example Usage                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| ${\land}$   | Logical _and_            | ${a \land b}$ (“${a}$ and ${b}$”)      |
| ${\lor}$    | Logical _or_             | ${a \lor b}$ (“${a}$ or ${b}$”)        |
| ${\neg}$    | Logical _not_            | ${\neg x}$ (“not ${x}$”)               |
| ${\exist}$  | _Existence_ predicate    | ${\exist x}$ (“there exists an ${x}$”) |
| ${\forall}$ | _Universality_ predicate | ${\forall x}$ (“for all ${x}$”)        |

## Set Theory
In Twine, the word _object_ refers to any entity that may be persisted in computer memory. We refer to an unordered collection of such entities with the word _set_.

:::definition
### Set
A _set_ is a collection of objects. By convention, we denote sets with upper-case Latin characters, and objects with lower-case Latin characters. Should a set comprise many elements, we use _ellipses_ (${\ldots}$) to denote the fact.
:::

__Example.__ The set ${S = \set{1, 10}}$ is a set comprising two objects, 1 and 10.

__Example.__ The set ${A = \set{1, 2, \ldots, 9, 10}}$ comprises 10 objects, the numbers ${1}$ through ${10.}$

:::definition
### Common Sets
We reserve the following symbols to denote particular sets:

| Symbol         | Set                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| ${\natnums}$   | The set of natural numbers |
| ${\Z}$         | The set of integers        |
| ${\mathbb{Q}}$ | The set of rationals       |
| ${\R}$         | The set of reals           |
| ${\Complex}$         | The set of complex numbers |
:::



:::definition
### Member
Given a set ${S,}$ if ${S}$ contains an object ${x,}$ we say that ${x}$ is a _member of_ ${S,}$ and write ${x \in S.}$ If ${x}$ is _not_ a member of ${S,}$ we write ${x \notin S.}$
:::

:::definition
### Empty Set
The _set_ containining no objects is called _the empty set_, denoted ${\varnothing.}$
:::

:::definition
### Strict Subset
Given sets ${A}$ and ${B,}$ if every element of ${A}$ is an element of ${B,}$ we say that ${A}$ is a _strict subset_ of ${B,}$ and write ${A \subset B.}$
