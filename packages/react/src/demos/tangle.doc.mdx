# Tangle
This is the documentation page for _Tangle_, _Twine_’s compiler. Because _Twine_ is geared towards symbolic manipulation, Part I of this documentation covers the mathematical background necessary for understanding _Tangle_’s architecture and implementation details. Part II provides an overview of the compiler’s API and implementation details. Finally, Part IV presents current limitations and plans for future improvements.

:::p1
part i
:::

This part introduces the basic mathematical background necessary to understanding this documentation’s exposition. Readers familiar with the outlined topics should skip to the Part II.

## Logic
The following symbols are used extensively throughout the documentation.

| Symbol      | Semantic                 | Example Usage                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| ${\land}$   | Logical _and_            | ${a \land b}$ (“${a}$ and ${b}$”)      |
| ${\lor}$    | Logical _or_             | ${a \lor b}$ (“${a}$ or ${b}$”)        |
| ${\neg}$    | Logical _not_            | ${\neg x}$ (“not ${x}$”)               |
| ${\exist}$  | _Existence_ predicate    | ${\exist x}$ (“there exists an ${x}$”) |
| ${\forall}$ | _Universality_ predicate | ${\forall x}$ (“for all ${x}$”)        |

## Set Theory
In Twine, the word _object_ refers to any entity that may be persisted in computer memory. We refer to an unordered collection of such entities with the word _set_.

:::definition
### Set
A _set_ is a collection of objects. By convention, we denote sets with upper-case Latin characters, and objects with lower-case Latin characters. Should a set comprise many elements, we use _ellipses_ (${\ldots}$) to denote the fact.
:::

__Example.__ The set ${S = \set{1, 10}}$ is a set comprising two objects, 1 and 10.

__Example.__ The set ${A = \set{1, 2, \ldots, 9, 10}}$ comprises 10 objects, the numbers ${1}$ through ${10.}$

:::definition
### Common Sets
We reserve the following symbols to denote particular sets:

| Symbol         | Set                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| ${\natnums}$   | The set of natural numbers |
| ${\Z}$         | The set of integers        |
| ${\mathbb{Q}}$ | The set of rationals       |
| ${\R}$         | The set of reals           |
| ${\Complex}$   | The set of complex numbers |
:::



:::definition
### Member
Given a set ${S,}$ if ${S}$ contains an object ${x,}$ we say that ${x}$ is a _member of_ ${S,}$ and write ${x \in S.}$ If ${x}$ is _not_ a member of ${S,}$ we write ${x \notin S.}$
:::

:::definition
### Empty Set
The _set_ containining no objects is called _the empty set_, denoted ${\varnothing.}$
:::

:::definition
### Strict Subset
Given sets ${A}$ and ${B,}$ if every element of ${A}$ is an element of ${B,}$ we say that ${A}$ is a _strict subset_ of ${B,}$ and write ${A \subset B.}$ 
:::

## Polynomials
Polynomials are particularly important in Twine, as they comrpise the bedrock of approximation.

:::definition
### Single-variable Polynomial
A _single-variable polynomial_ is an expression ${u}$ of the form:

$$
	u = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_1 + a_0,
$$

where ${x}$ is a _variable_, and each ${a}$ is a _rational number coefficient_. Where ${a_n \neq 0,}$ the coefficient ${a_n}$ is called the _leading cofficient_ of ${u,}$ and ${n}$ is called its _degree_.

This part of the documentation provides an overview of _Tangle_’s API, followed by summaries of its implementation details.

## Auxiliary Functions
_Tangle_ relies on various standalone helper functions. These functions are presented below.

### Numeric Functions
_Numeric functions_ are those that perform purely numeric computations.

#### rem
Given two numbers, ${a}$ and ${b,}$ returns the signed remainder of ${a}$ and ${b.}$ The function is equivalent to writing `a % b`.

:::tbl
| Parameters                 | Returns |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| (_a_: number, _b_: number) | number  |
:::

#### mod
Returns the remainder of ${a}$ and ${b}$ (i.e., ${a \bmod b}$). The function is equivalent to writing `((a % b) + b) % b`.

:::tbl
| Parameters                 | Returns |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| (_a_: number, _b_: number) | number  |
:::

#### quot
Returns the integer quotient of integers ${a}$ and ${b}$ (i.e., ${\lfloor a/b \rfloor}$).

:::tbl
| Parameters                 | Returns |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| (_a_: number, _b_: number) | number  |
:::

#### gcd 
Returns the greatest common divisor of integers ${a}$ and ${b.}$

:::tbl
| Parameters                 | Returns |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| (_a_: number, _b_: number) | number  |
:::

#### xgcd
Returns a triple corresponding to the result of the extended Euclidean algorithm.

:::tbl
| Parameters               | Returns                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| (_a_:number, _b_:number) | [number, number, number] |
