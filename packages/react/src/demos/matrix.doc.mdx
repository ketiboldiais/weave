# Matrix
This is the documentation page for the _Matrix_ submodule. Matrices can be instantiated in several ways Either with the _new_ keyword:

~~~ts
const M = new Matrix([
  v3D(1,0,0),
  v3D(0,1,0),
  v3D(0,0,1),
]);
~~~

or with the instatiating function _matrix_, which takes a nested array of numbers.

~~~ts
const M = matrix([
  [1,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,1],
]);
~~~

### _Matrix_._C __number__
The number of columns comprising the _Matrix_.

### _Matrix_._square __readonly boolean__
