# Reading & Writing Mathematics

Just as reading and analyzing fiction takes practice, so, too, does reading mathematics. In the exposition that follows, we survey the fundamentals of mathematical notation and literacy.

## Logic
A _statement_ or _proposition_, is a sentence that reduces to true or false, but not both. Statements can be _atomic_ or _compound_. For example, “Lazarus is alive” is a _atomic statement_, since Lazarus can only be either alive or dead (excluding the “undead”). Likewise, these are all atomic statements, some of which are true, others false:

1. 7 is prime.
2. ${1 \gt 0.}$
3. ${31 \neq 32.}$
4. ${2 + 5 = 25.}$
6. ${3/9 = 1/3.}$

Compound statements are statements formed with _logical connectives_ (the most common of which are _and_, _or_, _not_, _if ... then_, and _if and only if_). For example:

1. 5 divides 25 and 5 divides 30.
2. ${1 \lt 2 \lt 3.}$


## Definitions & Axioms
Mathematics begins at the definition or axiom. These are statements of absolute facts; we take them as is, without question. For example, that a quadrilateral comprises four sides is taken without more. The realm of questioning axioms and definitions belongs to mathematical logic or linguistics, fields beyond this page’s scope.

### Recursive Definitions
Mathematics relies extensively on _recursive definitions_ or _recursive algorithms_. These are definitions/algorithms that are defined in terms of a simpler – or an entirely different – version of themselves. The classic example is the definition of a factorial:

$$
	n! = \begin{cases}
		1 ~ &\text{if} ~~ n = 0 \\
		1 \cdot 2 \cdot \ldots \cdot (n - 1) \cdot n ~ &\text{if} ~~ n > 0 \\
		\text{undefined} &\text{else}.
	\end{cases}
$$

The above definition can be rewritten as:


$$
	n! = \begin{cases}
		1 ~ &\text{if} ~~ n = 0 \\
		n \cdot (n - 1)! ~ &\text{if} ~~ n > 0 \\
		\text{undefined} &\text{else}.
	\end{cases}
$$

A subtle point: Notice the period at the end of each _else_. Definitions are sentences, but they may be displayed in _block form_, as shown above, or in inline form: ${y = 5.}$ Block or inline, the grammar rule of terminating every sentence with a period applies.

## Expressions
The simplest unit of syntax in mathematics is the _expression_. The following are all expressions:

$$
	y ~~~~ 17 ~~~~ \pi ~~~~ 0.3333\ldots \\[1em]
	1 + 8 ~~~~ e^x~\text{d}x ~~~~ k! \\[1em]
	f(x) ~~~~ \int_{0}^{2} \frac{x^2}{3\cos x} ~~~~ \sum_{i=1}^{n} n \\[1em]
	\frac{3}{4} ~~~~ 3i + 1 ~~~~ 9.81
$$

We define a _mathematical expression_ as follows:

:::definition
__Mathematical Expression.__ A mathematical expression is either an _atom_ or a _compound_.

1. An _atom_ is an integer, real, variable (e.g., ${x,}$ ${f,}$ etc.), or constant (e.g., ${\pi,}$ ${e,}$ etc.).
2. A _compound_ is one or more expressions – each called an _operand_ – joined by a symbol called an _operator_. An operator may be:
	- an _algebraic operator_ (${+,}$ ${-}$, ${/}$, etc.),
	- a _relational operator_ (${=,}$ ${\lt,}$ ${\gt}$, etc.),
	- a _logical operator_ (${\land}$, ${\lor}$, etc.),
	- a _set operator_ (${\cup}$, ${\cap}$, etc.),
	- a _grouping operator_ (${(~)}$, ${\lbrace\rbrace}$, etc.), or
	- a _function name_ (${f,}$ ${g,}$ etc.).
