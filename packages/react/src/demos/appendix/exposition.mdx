# Reading & Writing Mathematics

Just as reading and analyzing fiction takes practice, so, too, does reading mathematics. In the exposition that follows, we survey the fundamentals of mathematical notation and literacy.

## Logic
A _proposition_ is a sentence that reduces to true or false, but not both. Propositions can be _atomic_ or _compound_. For example, “Lazarus is alive” is an _atomic proposition_, since Lazarus can only be either alive or dead (excluding the “undead”). Likewise, these are all atomic propositions, some of which are true, others false:

1. 7 is prime.
2. ${1 \gt 0.}$
3. ${31 \neq 32.}$
4. ${2 + 5 = 25.}$
6. ${3/9 = 1/3.}$

Compound propropositions are sentences formed with _logical connectives_ (the most common of which are _and_, _or_, _not_, _if ... then_, and _if and only if_). For example:

1. 5 divides 25 and 5 divides 30.
2. ${1 \lt 2 \lt 3.}$
3. If ${x = 2,}$ then ${x}$ is even.

These connectives are defined as follows:

:::definition
__Negation.__ Let ${p}$ be a proposition. The notation ${\neg p,}$ read “not ${p,}$” denotes the _negation_ of ${p,}$ defined as follows:

| ${p}$ | ${\neg p}$ |
| ----- | ---------- |
| true  | false      |
| false | true       |
:::

:::definition
__Conjunction.__ Let ${p}$ and ${q}$ be propositions. The notation ${p \land q,}$ read “${p}$ and ${q,}$” denotes the _conjunction_ of ${p}$ and ${q,}$ defined as follows:

| ${p}$ | ${q}$ | ${p \land q}$ |
| ----- | ----- | ------------- |
| true  | true  | true          |
| true  | false | false         |
| false | true  | false         |
| false | false | false         |
:::



:::definition
__Disjunction.__ Let ${p}$ and ${q}$ be propositions. The notation ${p \lor q,}$ read “${p}$ or ${q,}$” denotes the _disjunction_ of ${p}$ and ${q,}$ defined as follows:

| ${p}$ | ${q}$ | ${p \lor q}$ |
| ----- | ----- | ------------ |
| true  | true  | true         |
| true  | false | true         |
| false | true  | true         |
| false | false | false        |
:::


:::definition
__Mutual Exclusion.__ Let ${p}$ and ${q}$ be propositions. The notation ${p \oplus q,}$ read “either ${p}$ or ${q,}$” denotes the _mutual exclusion_ of ${p}$ and ${q,}$ defined as follows:

| ${p}$ | ${q}$ | ${p \oplus q}$ |
| ----- | ----- | -------------- |
| true  | true  | false          |
| true  | false | true           |
| false | true  | true           |
| false | false | false          |
:::


:::definition
__Implication.__ Let ${p}$ and ${q}$ be propositions. The notation ${p \implies q,}$ read “if ${p}$ then ${q,}$” denotes the _implication_ of ${q}$ by ${p,}$ defined as follows:

| ${p}$ | ${q}$ | ${p \implies q}$ |
| ----- | ----- | ---------------- |
| true  | true  | true             |
| true  | false | false            |
| false | true  | true             |
| false | false | true             |

Given ${p \implies q,}$ we call ${p}$ the _sufficient condition_ and ${q}$ the _necessary condition_.
:::

We have many options for expressing ${p \implies q}$ in prose:

|                                          |                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| if ${p,}$ then ${q}$                     | ${p}$ implies ${q}$                       |
| if ${p,}$ ${q}$                          | ${p}$ only if ${q}$                       |
| ${p}$ is sufficient for ${q}$            | a sufficient condition for ${q}$ is ${p}$ |
| ${q}$ if ${p}$                           | ${q}$ whenever ${p}$                      |
| ${q}$ when ${p}$                         | ${q}$ is necessary for ${p}$              |
| a necessary condition for ${p}$ is ${q}$ | ${q}$ follows from ${p}$                  |
| ${q}$ unless ${\neg p}$                  | ${p}$ but for ${\neg q}$                  |

Another connective often used in mathematics is the _biconditional_, almost always expressed with the connector “if and only if.” Note, however, that mathematicians are not logicians – they tend to play fast and loose with the biconditional and simply use “if” or “only if.” As always, context is key when reading mathematics.

:::definition
__Biconditional.__ Let ${p}$ and ${q}$ be propositions. The notation ${p \iff q,}$ read “${p}$ if and only if ${q,}$” denotes the _biconditional_ of ${p}$ and ${q,}$ defined as follows:

| ${p}$ | ${q}$ | ${p \iff q}$ |
| ----- | ----- | ------------ |
| true  | true  | true         |
| true  | false | false        |
| false | true  | false        |
| false | false | true         |

Given ${p \implies q,}$ we call ${p}$ the _sufficient condition_ and ${q}$ the _necessary condition_.

In mathematics, we’ll often read/hear the phrases “inversely,” “conversely,” or “by the contrapositive.” These terms relate to manipulations of logical implications. We define them as follows:

:::definition
__Converse.__ Let ${p}$ and ${q}$ be propositions. The _converse_ of the implication ${p \implies q}$ is the compound proposition ${q \implies p.}$
:::

In other words, the converse of an implication is the implication with its necessary and sufficient conditions swapped. For example, the converse of “If John is present, then Amy is absent” is “If Amy is absent, then John is present.”

:::definition
__Inverse.__ Given propositions ${p}$ and ${q,}$ the _inverse_ of the implication ${p \implies q}$ is the compound proposition ${\neg p \implies \neg q.}$
:::

That is, the inverse of an implication is the implication with the necessary and sufficient conditions negated. E.g., the converse of “If it’s sunny outside, then it isn’t cloudy” is “If it isn’t sunny outside, then it’s cloudy.”

:::definition
__Contrapositive.__ For propositions ${p}$ and ${q,}$ the _contrapositive_ of the implication ${p \implies q}$ is the compound proposition ${\neg q \implies \neg p.}$
:::

Put differently: The contrapositive of an implication is the inverse of its converse (swap the conditions and negate each). E.g., the proposition “If Milky is a cow, then Milky is mammal,” contrapositively, is “If Milky is not a mammal, then Milky is not a cow.”


## Definitions & Axioms
Mathematics begins at the definition or axiom. These are statements of absolute facts; we take them as is, without question. For example, that a quadrilateral comprises four sides is taken without more. The realm of questioning axioms and definitions belongs to mathematical logic or linguistics, fields beyond this page’s scope.

### Recursive Definitions
Mathematics relies extensively on _recursive definitions_ or _recursive algorithms_. These are definitions/algorithms that are defined in terms of a simpler – or an entirely different – version of themselves. The classic example is the definition of a factorial:

$$
	n! = \begin{cases}
		1 ~ &\text{if} ~~ n = 0 \\
		1 \cdot 2 \cdot \ldots \cdot (n - 1) \cdot n ~ &\text{if} ~~ n > 0 \\
		\text{undefined} &\text{else}.
	\end{cases}
$$

The above definition can be rewritten as:


$$
	n! = \begin{cases}
		1 ~ &\text{if} ~~ n = 0 \\
		n \cdot (n - 1)! ~ &\text{if} ~~ n > 0 \\
		\text{undefined} &\text{else}.
	\end{cases}
$$

A subtle point: Notice the period at the end of each _else_. Definitions are sentences, but they may be displayed in _block form_, as shown above, or in inline form: ${y = 5.}$ Block or inline, the grammar rule of terminating every sentence with a period applies.

## Expressions
The simplest unit of syntax in mathematics is the _expression_. The following are all expressions:

$$
	y ~~~~ 17 ~~~~ \pi ~~~~ 0.3333\ldots \\[1em]
	1 + 8 ~~~~ e^x~\text{d}x ~~~~ k! \\[1em]
	f(x) ~~~~ \int_{0}^{2} \frac{x^2}{3\cos x} ~~~~ \sum_{i=1}^{n} n \\[1em]
	\frac{3}{4} ~~~~ 3i + 1 ~~~~ 9.81
$$

We define a _mathematical expression_ as follows:

:::definition
__Mathematical Expression.__ A mathematical expression is either an _atom_ or a _compound_.

1. An _atom_ is an integer, real, variable (e.g., ${x,}$ ${f,}$ etc.), or constant (e.g., ${\pi,}$ ${e,}$ etc.).
2. A _compound_ is one or more expressions – each called an _operand_ – joined by a symbol called an _operator_. An operator may be:
	- an _algebraic operator_ (${+,}$ ${-}$, ${/}$, etc.),
	- a _relational operator_ (${=,}$ ${\lt,}$ ${\gt}$, etc.),
	- a _logical operator_ (${\land}$, ${\lor}$, etc.),
	- a _set operator_ (${\cup}$, ${\cap}$, etc.),
	- a _grouping operator_ (${(~)}$, ${\lbrace\rbrace}$, etc.), or
	- a _function name_ (${f,}$ ${g,}$ etc.).
