## Remainders
We begin with a definition of the remainder:

:::dfn
~definition: remainder~. Given integers ${a}$ and ${b,}$ there are unique integers ${q}$ and ${r}$ such that ${a = qb + r,}$ where ${0 \leq r \leq \lvert b \rvert + 1.}$ We call the integer ${q}$ the _quotient_ and the integer ${r}$ the _remainder_.
:::

_Example._ ${8 = q \cdot 3 + r = 2 \cdot 3 + 2.}$

_Example._ ${8 = q \cdot (-3) + r = (-2) \cdot (-3) + (2).}$

:::dfn
~definition: divisor~. Given integers ${a}$ and ${b}$ with ${b \neq 0,}$ we say that ${b}$ is a _divisor_ of (or _divides_) ${a}$ if there exists an integer ${q}$ such that ${a = q \cdot b.}$ If ${b}$ divides ${a,}$ we write ${b ~~\vert~~ a.}$ If ${b}$ does not divide ${a,}$ we write ${b \not\vert ~~ a.}$
:::

:::dfn
~definition: common divisor.~ Where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are integers, a _common divisor_ (or _common factor_) of ${a}$ and ${b}$ is an integer ${c}$ such that ${c ~~\vert~~ a}$ and ${c ~~ \vert ~~ b.}$
:::

:::dfn
~theorem.~ Let ${a,}$ ${b,}$ and ${c}$ be integers. Then:

1. If ${a \neq 0,}$ ${b \neq 0,}$ ${b ~~ \vert ~~ a}$ and ${a ~~ \vert ~~ b,}$ then ${a = \pm b.}$
2. If ${c \neq 0,}$ ${c ~~ \vert ~~ a,}$ and ${c ~~ \vert ~~ b,}$ then ${c ~~\vert~~ (a + b).}$
3. If ${c \neq 0}$ and ${c ~~ \vert ~~ a,}$ then ${c ~~ \vert ~~ (a \cdot b).}$
4. If ${a \neq 0,}$ ${b \neq 0,}$ ${a ~~ \vert ~~ b,}$ and ${b ~~ \vert ~~ c,}$ then ${a ~~ \vert ~~ c.}$
