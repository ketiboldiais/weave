# Set Theory

## Axioms
There are two versions of set theory: (1) __naive set theory__, and (2)
__axiomatic set theory__. We explore aspects of both theories in the
materials that follow. What are the differences? Naive set theory is the
version of set theory as originally constructed by the German mathematician
Georg Cantor. Axiomatic set theory is the version of set
theory constructed in response to several paradoxes, the most famous of
which is _Russell's Paradox_. In this chapter, we focus only on naive set
theory.

## Foundational Axioms
In mathematics, a __set__ is a collection of objects. Those objects might
be dogs, people, trees, numbers, values, variables, or more abstractly,
propositions. For example, the set of all coins includes nickels, sterling,
and yen. The set of all countries includes Japan, Palau, and Uruguay. The
set of all integers includes 1 and -117. We can visualize a set as:

:::

Sets can be finite (there are only so many countries), or infinite (there
are infinitely many of numbers). Each object in a set is called a
_member_ of that set.

### Axiom of Extension

The set $\{ 1, 2, 3 \}$ is the same as the set $\{ 2, 1, 3 \}$, and the same set
as $\{ 2, 2, 3, 1 \}$. We can draw this conclusion because of the _axiom of
extension_.

:::definition
__Axiom of Extension.__ Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same
elements.
:::


In short, the _axiom of extension_ provides that a set is completely determined
by what its elements are—it is irrelevant whether the elements are in order, or
whether an element is listed more than once.

### Axiom of Specification
The axiom of specification, also referred to as _Aussonderungsaxiom_, provides
the following:

:::definition
__Axiom of Specification.__ To every set ${A}$ and to every condition ${S(x),}$
there exists a set ${B}$ whose elements are exactly the elements ${x}$ of ${A,}$
for which ${S(x)}$ holds.
:::

Set theorists introduced the axiom of specification to get around some awkward
gaps philosophers noticed in the early 1900s. One such gap is Russell's Paradox,
discussed in a separate chapter. In essence, without the axiom of specification,
we get the conclusion that _nothing contains everything_.

While we could simply accept this as a kōan, it causes enough discomfort to warrant an axiom. The axiom of specification, in short, establishes that there exists a set we can specify (e.g., tailor) to a set we desire. A set that's “tailored” is said to be _well-defined_. We say that a set is well-defined if, for any given ${x,}$ we can determine whether ${x}$ is a member of the set. For example, the set ${L = \{x \in \reals \mid x > 4\}}$ is a well-defined set. Given any ${x,}$ we can determine whether ${x}$ is a member of ${L}$; ${x}$ must be a real number, and it must be greater than 4.  The set ${G = \{ 1, 4, 3, 9, \pi, \ldots \},}$ however, is not a well-defined set. Is ${3.2}$ a member of ${G?}$ We do not have enough conditions to make a determination.

### Axiom of Infinity
We state the axiom of infinity as follows:

:::definition
__Axiom of Infinity.__ There exists a set containing ${0}$ and the successor of each of its elements.
:::

The _axiom of infinity_ provides that there is _at least one_ infinite set. This may not seem important or interesting at this point, but it proves to be extremely useful at a later juncture. Of note, the axiom of infinity is a hot button issue in mathematics, and a minority of mathematicians question whether it is necessary at all.

## Set Notation
To help make our future discussions more efficient, let's agree on some basic
notation and terminology. First, the notion of logical identity.

:::dfn
__Logic Identity__. The expression

$$
  \large a = b
$$

means: ${a}$ and ${b}$ are symbols for the same object. If ${a}$ and ${b}$ are
different objects, we write:

$$
  \large a \neq b.
$$
:::

Sets can be expressed in a variety of ways:

- "The set of all integers whose square is between, and includes, one and
  nine."
- ${A = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} : x^2 \leq 9 \}}$
- ${B = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} : \lvert x \rvert \leq 3 \}}$
- ${C = \{ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 \}}$

Let's go over these approaches. We denote the notion of set membership with the
symbol ${\in.}$ This is a variant of the lowercase epsilon (${\epsilon}$), which
is the first letter of the Greek word ${ἐστί,}$ meaning "is."

:::dfn
__Set Membership__. Let ${A}$ be a set. The notation

$$
  a \in A
$$

means: ${a}$ _is_ an element of ${A.}$ If ${a}$ _is not_ an element of ${A,}$ we
write:

$$
  a \notin A.
$$
:::

A set may be made more explicit through __set roster notation__. For
instance, $\{ 0, 1, 2 \}$ is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 2. If
the set has too many elements to list, ellipses may be used. For example,
the set of all integers from 0 to 100 may be written as:
$\{ 0, 1, 2, \ldots , 100 \}$. Likewise, the set of all positive integers
may be written as $\{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}$.

We can also specify sets in __set builder notation__. Suppose that $S$ is a
set, and $P(x)$ is a property that elements of $S$ may or may not satisfy.
We can define a new set that contains all the elements of $S$ such that
$P(x)$ is true:

$$
 \{ x \in S \mid P(x) \}
$$

The pipe character, |, is shorthand for "such that." Thus, above notation
refers to all the elements of ${S}$ with the property $P(x)$. Note that in
some mathematical contexts, the phrase "such that" is often abbreviated
"s.t." or $\ni$. Thus, the above set may appear in some texts as:

$$
 \{ x \in S \ni P(x) \}, \space \text{or} \\[1em] \{ x \in S \text{ s.t. } P(x)
 \}
$$

## Subsets
Some sets are themselves elements of another set. These sets are called
__subsets__. For example, the set of all Herefords is a
subset of the set of all cows, and the set of all bonobos is a subset of
the set of all great apes. More formally:

:::dfn

__Subset__. Suppose ${A}$ and ${B}$ are sets. The set ${A}$ is a
_subset_ of ${B}$ if, and only if, _every_ element of ${A}$ is also an
element of ${B.}$ To denote this relationship, we write:

$$
  A \subseteq B
$$

If $A$ is not a subset of $B$, then we write:

$$
  A \nsubseteq B.
$$

:::

If ${A \subseteq B}$ is true, then we can infer: For every element ${x,}$ if ${x \in A,}$ then ${x \in B.}$ We describe ${A}$ and ${B's}$ relationship with statements such as "${A}$ is contained in $B$" and "${B}$ contains ${A.}$"

$$
  A \subseteq B \iff \forall x(x \in A \rArr x \in B)
$$

If $A \nsubseteq B$ is true, then we can infer: There is at least one element $x$ such that $x \in A$ and $x \notin B$. In other words, if $A$ is not a subset of $B$, then there is at least one element in $A$ that is not an element of ${B.}$

From the definition above, if we are asked to prove that ${A}$ is a subset of ${B,}$ we must show that if ${x}$ belongs to ${A,}$ then ${x}$ also belongs to ${B.}$ If we are asked to prove that ${A}$ is _not_ a subset of ${B,}$ we must find a single ${x}$ that belongs to ${A}$ but does not belong to ${B.}$

The definition above implies that the empty set is a subset of all sets, and a given set is a subset of itself. In other words, for the set ${A,}$ the sets ${\varnothing}$ and ${A}$ are subsets of ${A.}$ We say that ${A}$ and ${\varnothing}$ are __trivial subsets__ of ${A.}$

This follows directly from the definition. The proposition ${\varnothing \subseteq A}$ if, for all ${x \in \varnothing,}$ ${x \in A.}$ Because the sufficient condition, ${x \in \varnothing}$ is false, it follows that ${x \in A}$ is true. This is an example of a __vacuous proof__.

The case of ${A \subseteq A}$ straightforward. Given that ${A}$ and ${A}$ are the same sets, every ${x \in A}$ implies that ${x \in A.}$ Because the sufficient condition is true and the necessary condition is true, it follows that ${A \subseteq A}$ by definition.

### Proper Subsets
If a subset ${B}$ of ${A}$ is such that ${B \neq A}$ and
${B \neq \varnothing,}$ then we say that ${B}$ is called a proper subset of
${A.}$ For example, the set of all potatoes is a subset of all root
vegetables. It certainly isn't empty—you've got Yukon Golds, Russet
potatoes, Japanese sweet potatoes, LaRette potatoes, and so on. But it also
doesn't comprise the entire set of all root vegetables either, because
there are other root vegetables: taro, yams, tapioca, turmeric, ginseng,
ginger, beets, and so on. Thus, we say that, "Potatoes are a proper subset
of root vegetables," and write:
${\text{taro} \subset \text{root vegetables}.}$

$$
  A \subset B \iff [\forall x(x \in A \rArr x \in B) \land \exists x (x \in B
  \land x \notin A)]
$$

A subset is a general concept. When we say that ${A}$ is a "subset" of
${B,}$ we allow the possibility of ${A}$ and ${B}$ being equal. For
example, the set of all aardvarks is a subset of all Orycteropodidae, and
the set of all Orycteropodidae is a subset of all Tubulidentata. However,
aardvarks comprise all the members of Orycteropodidae, and Orycteropodidae
comprise all the members of Tubulidentata. Thus, these sets are all equal,
but are also subsets.

__Remark.__ In biology, a taxon (an instance of a taxonomy level, e.g., kingdom, phylum, class, etc.) with only one superset is called __monotypic__. Aardvarks, the Albany pitcher plant, the hyacinth macaw, among others are all monotypic.

Now, if some extinct species of Orycteropodidae comes back to life or some
new species is discovered, then the aardvarks would not comprise all of
Orycteropodidae. In that situation, aardvarks are no longer _just_ a subset
of Orycteropodidae. We can still refer to aardvarks as a subset of
Orycteropodidae, but we are now also permitted to more specifically say
that aardvarks are a _strict subset_ (or _proper subset_) of Orycteropodidae.

:::dfn
__Strict Subset__. Suppose ${A}$ and ${B}$ are sets. ${A}$ is a _proper
subset_ of ${B}$ if, and only if, every element of ${A}$ is in ${B,}$
but there is at least one element in $B$ that is not in $A$. If $A$ is a
proper subset of $B$, we write:

$$
  A \subset B
$$
:::

If ${A \subset B}$ is true, we can infer: All of the elements of ${A}$ are
elements of $B$, but there is at least one element of ${B}$ that is not an
element of ${A.}$ We can also infer that all the elements of ${A}$ have
some property in common that separate it from other subsets of ${B.}$

A helpful way to distinguish between the two symbols is noticing how they
share similarities to the symbols ${\leq}$ and ${<.}$ ${\subseteq }$ means
"subset or equal" and ${\subset}$ means "subset but not equal;" the former
is more general than the latter.

If $A \subset B$ is false (i.e., $A$ is not a proper subset of $B$), we
write:

$$
 A \not\subset B
$$

If $A \not\subset B$ is true, then either $A \not\subseteq B$ is true, or
$A \subseteq B$ is true, but no elements in $B$ are not in $A$.
