# Set Theory

## Axioms
There are two versions of set theory: (1) __naive set theory__, and (2)
__axiomatic set theory__. We explore aspects of both theories in the
materials that follow. What are the differences? Naive set theory is the
version of set theory as originally constructed by the German mathematician
Georg Cantor. Axiomatic set theory is the version of set
theory constructed in response to several paradoxes, the most famous of
which is _Russell's Paradox_. In this chapter, we focus only on naive set
theory.

## Foundational Axioms
In mathematics, a __set__ is a collection of objects. Those objects might
be dogs, people, trees, numbers, values, variables, or more abstractly,
propositions. For example, the set of all coins includes nickels, sterling,
and yen. The set of all countries includes Japan, Palau, and Uruguay. The
set of all integers includes 1 and -117. We can visualize a set as:

:::

Sets can be finite (there are only so many countries), or infinite (there
are infinitely many of numbers). Each object in a set is called a
_member_ of that set.

### Axiom of Extension

The set $\{ 1, 2, 3 \}$ is the same as the set $\{ 2, 1, 3 \}$, and the same set
as $\{ 2, 2, 3, 1 \}$. We can draw this conclusion because of the _axiom of
extension_.

:::definition
__Axiom of Extension.__ Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same
elements.
:::


In short, the _axiom of extension_ provides that a set is completely determined
by what its elements are—it is irrelevant whether the elements are in order, or
whether an element is listed more than once.

### Axiom of Specification
The axiom of specification, also referred to as _Aussonderungsaxiom_, provides
the following:

:::definition
__Axiom of Specification.__ To every set ${A}$ and to every condition ${S(x),}$
there exists a set ${B}$ whose elements are exactly the elements ${x}$ of ${A,}$
for which ${S(x)}$ holds.
:::

Set theorists introduced the axiom of specification to get around some awkward
gaps philosophers noticed in the early 1900s. One such gap is Russell's Paradox,
discussed in a separate chapter. In essence, without the axiom of specification,
we get the conclusion that _nothing contains everything_.

While we could simply accept this as a kōan, it causes enough discomfort to warrant an axiom. The axiom of specification, in short, establishes that there exists a set we can specify (e.g., tailor) to a set we desire. A set that's “tailored” is said to be _well-defined_. We say that a set is well-defined if, for any given ${x,}$ we can determine whether ${x}$ is a member of the set. For example, the set ${L = \{x \in \reals \mid x > 4\}}$ is a well-defined set. Given any ${x,}$ we can determine whether ${x}$ is a member of ${L}$; ${x}$ must be a real number, and it must be greater than 4.  The set ${G = \{ 1, 4, 3, 9, \pi, \ldots \},}$ however, is not a well-defined set. Is ${3.2}$ a member of ${G?}$ We do not have enough conditions to make a determination.

### Axiom of Infinity
We state the axiom of infinity as follows:

:::definition
__Axiom of Infinity.__ There exists a set containing ${0}$ and the successor of each of its elements.
:::

The _axiom of infinity_ provides that there is _at least one_ infinite set. This may not seem important or interesting at this point, but it proves to be extremely useful at a later juncture. Of note, the axiom of infinity is a hot button issue in mathematics, and a minority of mathematicians question whether it is necessary at all.

## Set Notation
To help make our future discussions more efficient, let's agree on some basic
notation and terminology. First, the notion of logical identity.

:::box
__Logic Identity__. The expression

$$
  \large a = b
$$

means: ${a}$ and ${b}$ are symbols for the same object. If ${a}$ and ${b}$ are
different objects, we write:

$$
  \large a \neq b.
$$
:::

Sets can be expressed in a variety of ways:

- "The set of all integers whose square is between, and includes, one and
  nine."
- ${A = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} : x^2 \leq 9 \}}$
- ${B = \{ x \in \mathbb{Z} : \lvert x \rvert \leq 3 \}}$
- ${C = \{ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 \}}$

Let's go over these approaches. We denote the notion of set membership with the
symbol ${\in.}$ This is a variant of the lowercase epsilon (${\epsilon}$), which
is the first letter of the Greek word ${ἐστί,}$ meaning "is."

:::box
__Set Membership__. Let ${A}$ be a set. The notation

$$
  a \in A
$$

means: ${a}$ _is_ an element of ${A.}$ If ${a}$ _is not_ an element of ${A,}$ we
write:

$$
  a \notin A.
$$
:::

A set may be made more explicit through __set roster notation__. For
instance, $\{ 0, 1, 2 \}$ is a set containing the elements 0, 1, and 2. If
the set has too many elements to list, ellipses may be used. For example,
the set of all integers from 0 to 100 may be written as:
$\{ 0, 1, 2, \ldots , 100 \}$. Likewise, the set of all positive integers
may be written as $\{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots \}$.

We can also specify sets in __set builder notation__. Suppose that $S$ is a
set, and $P(x)$ is a property that elements of $S$ may or may not satisfy.
We can define a new set that contains all the elements of $S$ such that
$P(x)$ is true:

$$
 \{ x \in S \mid P(x) \}
$$

The pipe character, |, is shorthand for "such that." Thus, above notation
refers to all the elements of ${S}$ with the property $P(x)$. Note that in
some mathematical contexts, the phrase "such that" is often abbreviated
"s.t." or $\ni$. Thus, the above set may appear in some texts as:

$$
 \{ x \in S \ni P(x) \}, \space \text{or} \\[1em] \{ x \in S \text{ s.t. } P(x)
 \}
$$
