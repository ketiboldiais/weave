# Geometry


## Points
The simplest entity in Euclidean geometry is a __point__ – a position. Below are several random points. We draw points with a dot, but this is purely for aesthetic purposes. Points have no physicality; no width, no height, no size, nothing quantifiable.

<Point1/>

## Line Segments
A straight path from one point to another is called a __segment__. By convention, we denote a segment with an line above the two constituent points. For example, the line segment below is denoted ${\overline{AB}.}$

<LineSegment1/>

The point directly between ${A}$ and ${B}$ is called the __midpoint__ of ${\overline{AB}.}$ In this case, we have labeled the point ${M.}$

<Midpoint1/>

Notice the two ticks we’ve placed on the segments ${\overline{MA}}$ and ${\overline{MB}}$ respectively. These ticks indicate that the segments ${\overline{MA}}$ and ${\overline{MB}}$ have the same length.

## Rays
With a single point, we may draw a straight path extending from that point in some direction infinitely. We call this figure a __ray__.

<Ray1/>

## Lines
With two points, we may draw a straight path through both points, extending infinitely in both directions. This we call a __line__. Points that lie along the line are said to be __collinear__.

<Line1/>

Three or more lines that pass through a single point are said to be __concurrent__ with one another.

<Concurrent1/>

## Circles
The set of all points equidistant from a given point (called the __center__) is called a __circle__. By convention, we denote circles with the notation ${\odot L,}$ where ${L}$ is the circle’s center label. For example, below is a circle ${\odot C.}$

<Circle1/>

Some observations on circles: First, we can always draw a line that does not “hit” (more formally, _intersect_) the circle.

<CircleNoHit/>

Second, we can draw a line that intersects the circle at exactly one point. Such a line is called a __tangent line__.

<CircleTangent/>

Third, a line can intersect _at most_ two points on a circle. Such a line (one that runs through a circle) is called a __secant line__.

<CircleSecant/>

The segment ${\overline{XY}}$ is called a __chord__ – a line segment connecting two points on a circle. The segment ${\overline{AB}}$ is called a __diameter__ – a chord whose midpoint is the center of the circle. The segment ${\overline{CB}}$ (as well as the segment ${\overline{CA}}$) is called the __radius__ – a segment comprising half a diameter of a circle.

_Exercise._ Two circles and three straight lines are __coplanar__ (that is, those which lie on the same plane). If none of the figures are __coincident__ (i.e., the two circles are different and the three lines are different), what is the maximum possible number of points at which at least two of the five figures intersect?
