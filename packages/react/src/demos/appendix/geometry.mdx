# Geometry


## Points

The simplest entity in Euclidean geometry is a __point__ – a position. Below are several random points. We draw points with a dot, but this is purely for aesthetic purposes. Points have no physicality; no width, no height, no size, nothing quantifiable.

<Point1/>

## Line Segments

A straight path from one point to another is called a __segment__. By convention, we denote a segment with an line above the two constituent points. For example, the line segment below is denoted ${\overline{AB}.}$

<LineSegment1/>

The point directly between ${A}$ and ${B}$ is called the __midpoint__ of ${\overline{AB}.}$ In this case, we have labeled the point ${M.}$


<Midpoint1/>

## Rays

With a single point, we may draw a straight path extending from that point in some direction infinitely. We call this figure a __ray__.

<Ray1/>

## Lines

With two points, we may draw a straight path through both points, extending infinitely in both directions. This we call a __line__. Points that lie along the line are said to be __collinear__.

<Line1/>

Three or more lines that pass through a single point are said to be __concurrent__ with one another.

<Concurrent1/>

## Circles
The set of all points equidistant from a given point (called the __center__) is called a __circle__. By convention, we denote circles with the notation ${\odot L,}$ where ${L}$ is the circle’s center label. For example, below is a circle ${\odot C.}$

<Circle1/>

Some observations on circles: First, we can always draw a line that does not “hit” (more formally, _intersect_) the circle.

<CircleNoHit/>

Second, we can draw a line that intersects the circle at exactly one point. Such a line is called a __tangent line__.

<CircleTangent/>

Third, a line can intersect _at most_ two points on a circle. Such a line (one that runs through a circle) is called a __secant line__.
