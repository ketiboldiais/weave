# Mechanics

The three fundamental quantities of mechanics are _length_, _mass_, and _time_.
We measure length with _meters_, mass with _kilograms_, and time with _seconds_.

:::definition
__Length.__ Let ${A}$ and ${B}$ be points in space. We define _length_ to mean the distance between ${A}$ and ${B.}$
:::

:::definition
__Mass.__ Let ${m}$ be an object. The _mass_ of ${m}$ is a measure of how much ${m}$ resists changes in its motion.
:::

For these materials, we will time in terms of an atomic clock, a device which measures vibrations of cesium atoms.

:::definition
__Time.__ We define time to mean ${9~192~631~770}$ times the period of vibration of radiation from the cesium-133 atom.

## 1D Motion

:::definition
__Position.__ Let ${m}$ be an object and ${S}$ a coordinate system. The _position_ of ${m}$ is the location of ${m}$ with respect to a chosen reference point called the _origin_ of ${S.}$
:::

:::definition
__Definition.__ Where ${m}$ is an object, the displacement of ${m}$ is the change in the position of ${m.}$ That is,

$$
	\Delta x \equiv x_f - x_i,
$$

where ${x_f}$ is the final position of ${m}$ and ${x_i}$ is the initial position of ${m.}$ The _length_ of the path ${m}$ takes from ${x_i}$ to ${x_f}$ is called the _distance_ that ${m}$ travels from ${x_i}$ to ${x_f.}$
