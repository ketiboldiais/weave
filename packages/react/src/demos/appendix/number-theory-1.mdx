## Division

:::definition
__Definition.__ If ${a}$ and ${b}$ are integers with ${a \neq 0,}$ then we say that ${a}$ divides ${b}$ if and only if there exists an integer ${c}$ such that ${b = a \cdot c}$ (or, put differently, ${b / a}$ is an integer). If ${a}$ divides ${b,}$ we write:

$$
	a ~ \vert ~ b.
$$

If ${a}$ does not divide ${b,}$ we write:

$$
	a \not\vert ~~ b.
$$
:::

For example, ${3 ~ \vert ~ 6,~}$ since ${3 \times 2 = 6.}$ Likewise, ${4 ~ \vert ~ 100,~}$ since ${4 \times 25 = 100.}$ But ${5 \not\vert ~~ 12,}$ since 12 cannot be divided into 5 equal parts.

:::definition
__Theorem.__ Let ${a,}$ ${b,}$ and ${c}$ be integers, with ${a \neq 0.}$ Then:

1. If ${a ~ \vert ~ b}$ and ${a ~ \vert ~ c,}$ then ${a ~\vert~ (b + c).}$
2. If ${a ~\vert~ b,}$ then ${a ~\vert~ bc}$ for all integers ${c.}$
3. If ${a ~\vert~ b}$ and ${b ~\vert~ c,}$ then ${a ~\vert~ c.}$

:::definition
__Corollary.__ If ${a,}$ ${b,}$ and ${c}$ are integers, with (i) ${a \neq 0,}$ (ii) ${a ~\vert~ b,}$ and (iii) ${a ~\vert~ c,}$ then ${a ~\vert~ (mb + nc)}$ for all integers ${m}$ and ${n.}$

## The Division Algorithm
Where ${a}$ is an integer and ${d}$ is a positive integer, there are unique integers ${q}$ and ${r}$ with ${0 \leq r \lt d}$ such that ${a = dq + r.}$ We call ${d}$ the _divisor_, ${a}$ the _dividend_, ${q}$ the quotient, and ${r}$ the remainder. We may express these relations as follows:

$$
	q = a ~\text{div}~ d, ~~~ r = a ~\text{rem}~ d
$$

If ${a}$ is an integer and ${d}$ is a positive integer, we have:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		a ~\text{div}~ d &= \left\lfloor \frac{a}{d} \right\rfloor, \\[1em]
		a ~\text{rem}~ d &= a - d.
	\end{aligned}
$$

## Modular Arithmetic
Suppose the current time is 1200 (12:00PM) When a person says, “The email will autosend 25 hours from now,” they mean 1300 (1:00PM), rather than 3700 (?). This is an example of _modular arithmetic_ – arithmetic over a finite set of integers. For 24-hour clocks, we perform the arithmetic of hours in _modulo-24_: ${12 + 25 = 37,}$ and ${37}$ divided by ${24}$ yields the quotient ${1}$ with a remainder of ${13.}$

:::definition
__Definition.__ If ${a,}$ ${b,}$ and ${m}$ are integers and ${m \gt 0,}$ then ${a}$ is _congruent to ${b}$ modulo ${m}$_ if, and only if, ${m}$ divides ${a - b.}$ We express this relation with the notation:

$$
	a \equiv b ~~ (\bmod ~ m).
$$

We say that ${a \equiv b ~~ (\bmod ~ m)}$ is a _congruence_ with a modulus of ${m.}$ If ${a}$ and ${b}$ are not congruent to modulo ${m,}$ we write:

$$
	a \not\equiv b ~~ (\bmod ~ m).
$$

:::definition
__Theorem.__ Let ${a,}$ ${b,}$ and ${m}$ be integers, where ${m \gt 0.}$ Then ${a \equiv b ~~ (\bmod ~ m)}$ if and only if ${a ~\text{rem}~ m = b ~\text{rem}~ m.}$
:::

:::definition
__Theorem.__ Let ${m}$ be a positive integer. The integers ${a}$ and ${b}$ are congruent modulo ${m}$ if, and only if, there is an integer ${k}$ such that ${a = b + km.}$
:::

:::definition
__Theorem.__ Let ${m}$ be a positive integer. If ${a \equiv b ~~ (\bmod ~ m),}$ and ${c \equiv d ~~ (\bmod ~ m),}$ then:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	a + c &\equiv b + d ~~ (\bmod ~ m), ~~ \text{and} \\[1em]
	ac &\equiv bd ~~ (\bmod ~ m)
\end{aligned}
