# Foundational Mathematics
This page provides an overview of the foundational concepts and skills necessary to comprehending the rest of the appendix materials. Much of the materials that follow may be found in the standard “precalculus” course of U.S. curricula.

## Sets
- A _set_ ${S}$ is a collection of objects, each called an _element_ of ${S.}$
	- If ${x}$ is an element of ${S,}$ we write ${x \in S.}$
	- If ${x}$ is not an element of ${S,}$ we write ${x \notin S.}$
	- A set is said to be _well-defined_ if and only if, given an object ${x,}$ then either ${x \in S}$ or ${x \notin S,}$ and the definition of ${S}$ determines which of these two possibilites holds.
- A set is called a _finite set_ if it contains a finite number of elements.
- A set is called an _infinite set_ if it contains an infinite number of elements.

### Cardinality
- The number of elements in a set ${S}$ is called the _cardinality_ or _cardinal number_ of ${S.}$ Given a set ${S,}$ we denote its cardinality with the notation ${\texttt{\#}S.}$

__~examples~.__
- ${A = \set{a,b,c}.}$
	- ${\texttt{\#}A = 3.}$
- ${B =  \set{ x ~|~ x \text{ is a prime number less than 10. }}}$
	- ${B = \set{2,3,5,7}.}$
	- ${\texttt{\#}B = 4.}$

- For a set ${S}$ of sufficiently small ${\texttt{\#}S,}$ we may define ${S}$ with braces. For example, if ${S}$ is the set of binary digits, then ${S = \set{0,1}.}$
- Otherwise, we will define sets with _set-builder notation_:
	$$
		S = \set{\theta ~\vert~ \text{$\theta$ is a real number with $0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi$}}.
	$$
- There is exactly one set containing no elements, called the _empty set_. We denote the empty set with the symbol ${\varnothing.}$

### Subsets
- If every element of a set ${B}$ is also an element of a set ${A,}$ then ${B}$ is a _subset_ of ${A,}$ and we write ${B \subseteq A.}$
- If every element of a set ${B}$ is also an element of a set ${A}$ and ${B \neq A}$ nor is ${B = \varnothing,}$ then ${B}$ is a _proper subset_ of ${A,}$ and we write ${B \subset A.}$

### Set Equality
- Two sets ${A}$ and ${B}$ are _equal_ if and only if ${A \subseteq B}$ and ${B \subseteq A.}$
- To prove that two sets are equal, we must prove that:
	1. For all ${x \in A,}$ ${x \in A \implies x \in B.}$ This proves that ${A \subseteq B.}$
	2. For all ${x \in B,}$ ${x \in B \implies x \in A.}$ This proves that ${B \subseteq A.}$
	3. Since ${A \subseteq B}$ and ${B \subseteq A,}$ it follows that ${A \in B.}$
:::
:::section
### Power Sets
- The set of subsets of a set ${A}$ is called the _power set_, denoted ${P(A),}$ of ${A.}$
- Let ${S}$ be a set. Then the cardinality of the power set of ${S}$ is given by:
	$$
		\texttt{\#}(P(S)) = 2^n.
	$$
	- ~proof.~ For every subset of ${S,}$ there are two possibilites for each element ${x \in S.}$ Either ${x}$ is in the subset, or ${x}$ is not in the subset. Thus, for all ${n}$ elements of ${S,}$ there will be ${2^n}$ different choices in constructing a subset of ${S.}$
- ~example.~ Let ${S = \set{a,b,c}.}$ We know that ${\texttt{\#}S = 3.}$ Thus, we have ${2^3 = 8}$ possible subsets:
	$$
		\begin{matrix}
			& \varnothing & \set{a} & \set{b} & \set{c} \\[.5em]
			& \set{a,b} & \set{b,c} & \set{a,c} & \set{a,b,c}
		\end{matrix}
	$$

### Union
- The set of all elements in sets ${A}$ _or_ ${B}$ _or_ both is called the _union_ of ${A}$ and ${B,}$ denoted ${A \cup B.}$

### Disjoint Sets
- Let ${A}$ and ${B}$ be sets. If ${A \cap B = \varnothing}$ (that is, ${A}$ and ${B}$ have no common elements), then we say that ${A}$ and ${B}$ are _disjoint_.
:::
:::section
### Partitions
- Where ${C = A \cup B,}$ if ${A \cap B = \varnothing}$ (that is, ${A}$ and ${B}$ are disjoint), then we say that ${A}$ and ${B}$ _partition_ ${C.}$
:::
::::

### Complement
- Let ${S \subset U.}$ The complement of ${S,}$ denoted ${S',}$ is the set of all elements in ${U}$ that are not in ${A.}$ 
::::right
:::figure
<Complement1/>
:figcaption[$S \subset U.$]
:::
::::
- ~example~. Where ${S = \set{a,b,c}}$ and ${U = \set{a,b,c,d,e},}$ then ${S' = \set{d,e}.}$

### Set Difference
- Where ${A}$ and ${B}$ are sets, the _difference_ between ${A}$ and ${B,}$ denoted ${A \setminus B,}$ is defined as ${A \setminus B = \set{x ~|~ x \in A \text{ and } x \notin B}.}$

### Symmetric Difference
- The symmetric difference between sets ${A}$ and ${B,}$ denoted ${A \triangle B,}$ is defined as ${A \triangle B = (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A).}$

### Properties of Set Algebra
::::grid{cols=3}
:::section
- ${A \cap B \subseteq A \cup B.}$
- If ${A \cup B = A \cap B,}$ then ${A = B.}$
- ${A \cup B = A}$ if and only if ${B \subseteq A.}$

### Ordered Pairs
:::dfn
__Kuratowski’s Definition.__ Let ${a}$ and ${b}$ be objects. Then the ordered pair ${(a,b)}$ is the set ${\set{\set{a}, \set{a,b}}.}$ 
:::
- ~example.~ The ordered pair ${(x,y)}$ is the set ${\set{\set{x}, \set{x,y}}.}$
- ~example.~ The ordered pair ${(y,x)}$ is the set ${\set{\set{y}, \set{x,y}}.}$ Note that the set ${\set{x,y}}$ is the same set as ${\set{y,x},}$ since there is no notion of ordering within sets. We could also have written ${(y,x) = \set{\set{y}, \set{y,x}}.}$
- The name “ordered pair” is a misnomer. There is no such thing as “first” or “second” in ordered pairs. The facts we have so far are insufficent to establishing a notion of “order.”
- Ordered pairs provide one, and only one, tool: The ability to differentiate between the pairs ${(a,b)}$ and ${(b,a).}$ This is accomplished via the following reasoning:
	1. We know that the set ${\set{a,b}}$ is the same set as ${\set{b,a}.}$
	2. Under Kuratowski’s definition:
		- ${(a,b) = \set{\set{a}, \set{a,b}}.}$
		- ${(b,a) = \set{\set{b}, \set{a,b}}.}$
	3. The sets ${\set{\set{a}, \set{a,b}}}$ and ${\set{\set{b}, \set{a,b}}}$ are different sets, since ${\set{a} \neq \set{b}.}$ And because they are different sets, ${(a,b) \neq (b,a).}$
::::

::::section
### Cartesian Products	
- Let ${A}$ and ${B}$ be sets, with ${a \in A}$ and ${b \in B.}$ The set of all ordered pairs ${(a,b)}$ such that ${a \in A}$ and ${b \in B}$ is called the Cartesian product of ${A}$ and ${B,}$ written ${A \times B.}$ That is,
	$$
		A \times B = \set{(a,b) ~|~ a \in A, b \in B}.
	$$
- ~example~. Let ${A = \set{0,1}}$ and let ${B = \set{a,b,c}.}$ Then:
	$$
		A \times B =
			\begin{Bmatrix}
				(0,a) & (0,b) & (0,c) \\
				(1,a) & (1,b) & (1,c)
			\end{Bmatrix}
	$$
:::dfn
__Cartesian Cardinal.__ Given sets ${A}$ and ${B,}$ the cardinality of ${A \times B}$ is given by the formula:
$$
	\texttt{\#}(A \times B) = \texttt{\#}A \times \texttt{\#}B.
$$
:::
::::
:::::

### Relations
- A _relation_ is any set of ordered pairs.
- Given sets ${A}$ and ${B:}$
	1. Any subset of ${A \times B}$ is a relation.
	2. If ${R}$ is a relation and ${(x,y) \in R,}$ we write ${x ~\texttt{R}~ y}$ to denote “${x}$ is related to ${y.}$”
	3. If ${R \subseteq A \times B,}$ then we say that ${R}$ is “a relation from ${A}$ to ${B.}$”
- Where ${R = X \times Y,}$
	- ${X}$ is called the _natural domain_ of ${R.}$
	- ${Y}$ is called the _image_ of ${R.}$
- If ${R}$ is a relation from ${A}$ to ${B,}$ then the _domain_ of ${R}$ is a subset of ${A,}$ and the _range_ of ${R}$ is a subset of ${B.}$
- If ${R \subseteq A \times A,}$ we say that “${R}$ is a relation in ${A.}$”

#### Reflexive Relations	
- A relation ${R}$ in ${S}$ is _reflexive_ iff for all ${x \in S,}$ it follows that ${x ~\texttt{R}~ x.}$
- ~example~. Suppose ${S = \set{1,2,3,4}.}$ A relation ${R}$ in ${S}$ is reflexive if and only if ${\set{(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4)} \subseteq R.}$

#### Symmetric Relations
- A relation ${R}$ in ${S}$ is _symmetric_ iff for all ${x,y \in S,}$ it follows that ${x ~\texttt{R}~ y}$ implies ${y ~\texttt{R}~ x.}$

#### Transitive Relations
- A relation ${R}$ in ${S}$ is _transitive_ iff for all ${a,b,c \in S,}$ it follows that, if ${a ~\texttt{R}~ c}$ and ${b ~\texttt{R}~ c,}$ then ${a ~\texttt{R}~ c.}$

#### Equivalence Relations
- A relation ${R}$ in ${S}$ is an equivalence relation if ${R}$ is both reflexive, transitive, and symmetric.

#### Equivalence Classes
- Suppose ${S}$ is a set and ${R}$ is an [equivalence relation](#equivalence-relations) in ${S.}$ If ${R}$ [partitions](#partitions) ${S,}$ then we call each partition resulting ${R}$ an _equivalence class_.

## Numbers
- The set of natural numbers comprises ${\set{0,1,2,\ldots}.}$ We denote this set with the symbol ${\mathbb{N}.}$
	- Some authors exclude ${0}$ from the natural numbers. We do not.
- The set of integers comprises ${\set{\ldots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\ldots}.}$ We denote this set with the symbol ${\mathbb{Z}.}$
- The set of rational numbers comprises numbers of the form
	$$
		r = \dfrac{m}{n},
	$$
	where ${m}$ and ${n}$ are integers, with ${n \neq 0.}$ We denote the set of rational numbers with the symbol ${\mathbb{Q}.}$
- The set ${\mathbb{Q}'}$ (the set of numbers _not_ rational) is called the set of _irrational numbers_.
	- ~example~. ${\sqrt{3},}$ ${\sqrt{5},}$ ${\sqrt[3]{2},}$ ${\pi,}$ ${\dfrac{3}{\pi^2}}$
	- ~warning~. ${n/0}$ is undefined (e.g., ${0/0}$).
- The set of naturals, integers, rationals, and irrationals comprise the set of all real numbers, denoted ${\mathbb{R}.}$

## Properties of Reals
- Where ${a}$ and ${b}$ are real numbers:
::::grid{cols=2}
:::section
- __Commutativity of Addition.__
	- ${a + b = b + a.}$
	- That is, when we add two numbers, order is irrelevant (the summands are free to “commute” or “travel”).
- __Associativity of Addition.__
	- ${(a + b) + c = a + (b + c).}$
	- I.e., when we add three numbers, which two numbers we add first is irrelevant (the summands are free to “asssociate” or “gather”).
:::
:::section
- __Commutativity of Multiplication.__
	- ${a \cdot b = b \cdot a.}$
- __Associativity of Multiplication.__
	- ${a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c.}$
- __Distributivity.__ 
	- ${a \cdot (b + c) = ab + ac,}$
	- and ${(b + c) \cdot a = ba + ca.}$

### Properties of Negatives
- Given a real number ${a,}$
	- ${(-1)a = -a.}$
	- ${-(-a) = a.}$
	- ${(-a)b = a(-b) = -(ab).}$
	- ${(-a)(-b) = ab.}$
	- ${-(a + b) = -a - b.}$
	- ${-(a - b) = b - a.}$
:::	
:::section
### Properties of Rationals
- Let ${a}$ and ${b}$ be integers. Then:
	- ${\dfrac{a}{b} \cdot \dfrac{c}{d} = \dfrac{ac}{bd}}$ 
	- ${{\dfrac{a}{b}}/{\dfrac{c}{d}} = \dfrac{a}{b} \cdot \dfrac{d}{c}}$
	- ${\dfrac{a}{c} + \dfrac{b}{c} = \dfrac{a + b}{c}}$
	- ${\dfrac{a}{b} + \dfrac{c}{d} = \dfrac{ab + bc}{cd}}$
	- ${\dfrac{ac}{bc} = \dfrac{a}{b}}$
	- If ${\dfrac{a}{b} = \dfrac{c}{d},}$ then ${ad = bc.}$

## The Real Line 
- The _real line_ is a visual representation of the set ${\reals.}$

:::figure
<RealLine/>
:figcaption[The real line.]
:::

- This representation communicates the fact that the real numbers are _ordered_.
- Given two numbers ${a}$ and ${b}$ on the real line:
	1. We say that “${a}$ is less than ${b}$” (denoted ${a \lt b}$) if ${b - a}$ is a positive real number. This is equivalent to saying “${b}$ is greater than ${a}$” (denoted ${b \gt a}$).
	2. We say that “${a}$ is less than or equal to ${b}$” (denoted ${a \leq b}$) if ${a \lt b}$ or ${a = b.}$ This is equivalent to saying “${b}$ is greater than or equal to ${a}$” (denoted ${b \geq a}$).


## Intervals
- Where ${a \in \mathbb{R}}$ and ${b \in \mathbb{R},}$ with ${a \lt b,}$
	1. The _open interval_, denoted ${(a,b),}$ is the set ${\set{x \in \reals | a \lt x \lt b}.}$
	2. The _closed interval_, denoted ${[a,b],}$ is the set ${\set{x \in \reals | a \leq x \leq b}.}$
	3. The _left-open interval_, denoted ${(a,b],}$ is the set ${\set{x \in \reals | a \lt x \leq b}.}$
	4. The _right-open interval_, denoted ${[a,b),}$ is the set ${\set{x \in \reals | a \leq x \lt b}.}$
- The intersection of two intervals ${I_a}$ and ${I_b}$ comprises all real numbers in both ${I_a}$ and ${I_b.}$
	- ~example~. ${(1,3) \cap [2,7]}$ is the interval ${\set{x | 1 \lt x \lt 3 \text{ and } 2 \leq x \leq 7}.}$
- The union of two intervals ${I_a}$ and ${I_b}$ comprises all real numbers in ${I_a,}$ ${I_b,}$ or both.
	- ~example~. ${(1,3) \cup [2,7]}$ is the interval ${\set{x | 1 \lt x \lt 3 \text{ or } 2 \leq x \leq 7}.}$

## Absolute Value
- The absolute value of a number ${x,}$ denoted ${\lvert x \rvert,}$ is the distance from ${x}$ to ${0}$ on the real line.
- More generally: If ${x}$ is a real number, then the _absolute value_ of ${x}$ is
	$$
		\lvert x \rvert = \begin{cases}
			x &\text{ if } a \geq 0 \\
			-x &\text{ else }
		\end{cases}.
	$$
- The _distance_ between two points ${a}$ and ${b}$ on the real line is defined as:
	$$
		\text{distance}(a,b) = \lvert b - a \rvert.
	$$ 
	- Given the property that ${ \lvert b - a \rvert = \lvert a - b \rvert,}$ it follows that the distance from ${a}$ to ${b}$ is equal to the distance from ${b}$ to ${a.}$
	- It thus follows that the ${\text{distance}}$ operator is _commutative_.

### Properties of Absolute Values
1. The absolute value of a number is always positive or zero: ${\lvert a \rvert \geq 0.}$ 
2. A number and its additive inverse have the same absolute value: ${\lvert a \rvert = \lvert -a \rvert.}$
3. The absolute value of a product is the product of the absolute values: ${\lvert ab \rvert = \lvert a \rvert \cdot \lvert b \rvert.}$
4. The absolute value of a quotient is the quotient of the absoluet values: ${\lvert a/b \rvert = \lvert a \rvert / \lvert b \rvert.}$

:::dfn
__Triangle Inequality.__ ${\lvert a + b \rvert \leq \lvert a \rvert + \lvert b \rvert.}$
:::


## Exponents
### Integer Exponents
- If ${x}$ is any real number and ${n}$ is a positive integer, then the ${n^{\text{th}}}$ power of ${x}$ is
	$$
		x^n = \underbrace{x \cdot x \cdot \ldots x \cdot x}_{n~~\text{factors}}.
	$$
	The	number ${x}$ is called the _base_, and ${n}$ is called the _exponent_.
- Where ${x}$ and ${y}$ are real numbers, and ${a}$ and ${b}$ are integers:
	::::grid{cols=2} 
	:::section
	- If ${x \neq 0,}$ then ${x^0 = 1}$ and ${x^{-n} = \dfrac{1}{x^n}.}$
	- ${x^{a} x^{b} = x^{a + b}.}$
	- ${\dfrac{x^a}{x^b} = x^{a - b}.}$
	- ${(x^a)^b = a^{a \cdot b}.}$

## Radicals
- The notation ${\sqrt{a} = b}$ implies that ${b^2 = a.}$
- Where ${n}$ is a positive integer, the principal ${n^{\text{th}}}$ root of ${a}$ is defined as
	$$
		\sqrt[n]{a} = b.
	$$ 
	If ${n}$ is even, then ${a \geq 0}$ and ${b \geq 0.}$
- Where ${n}$ and ${n}$ are integers and ${a}$ and ${b}$ are real numbers:
	1. ${\sqrt[n]{ab} = \sqrt[n]{a} \sqrt[n]{b}.}$ 
	2. ${\sqrt[n]{ \dfrac{a}{b} } = \dfrac{\sqrt[n]{a}}{\sqrt[n]{b}}.}$
	3. ${\sqrt[m]{\sqrt[n]{a}} = \sqrt[m \cdot n]{a}.}$
	4. ${\sqrt[n]{a^n} = a}$ if ${n}$ is odd.
	5. ${\sqrt[n]{a^n} = \lvert a \rvert}$ if ${n}$ is even.

:::grid{cols=2}
### Rational Exponents 
- For any rational exponent ${m/n}$ in lowest terms, where ${m}$ and ${n}$ are integers and ${n \gt 0,}$ we define
	$$
		a^{m/n} = \left(\sqrt[n]{a}\right)^m,
	$$ 
	or, equalivalently:
	$$
		a^{m/n} = \sqrt[n]{a^m}.
	$$
	If ${n}$ is even, then we require that ${a \geq 0.}$

### Rationalizing Denominators
- We _rationalize a denominator_ by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by a common expression.
	- ~example~. ${ \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{a}} = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \cdot 1 = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \cdot \dfrac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{a}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{a}}{a} }$
:::

## Polynomials
- A _monomial_ is an expression of the form ${ax^k,}$ where ${a}$ is a real number and ${k}$ is a nonnegative integer.
- A _binomial_ is a sum of two monomials.
- A _trinomial_ is a sum of three monomials.
- More generally, a sum of monomials is called a _polynomial_.
:::dfn
__Definition.__ A _polynomial in ${x}$_ is an expression of the form:
$$
	a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + a_1 x + a_0
$$ 
where ${a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n}$ are real numbers, and ${n}$ is a nonnegative integer. If ${a_n \neq 0,}$ then the polynomial has degree ${n.}$ The monomials ${a_k x^k}$ comprising the polynomial are called the _terms_ of the polynomial.
:::
	
### Adding & Subtracting Polynomials	
- Polynomials may be added and subtracted by applying the [properties of reals](#properties-of-reals) to _like terms_ (terms with the same variables raised to the same powers) using the distributive property.
	- ~example~. ${5x^2 + 3x^2 = (5 + 3)x^2 = 8x^2.}$
- When subtracting polynomials, keep in mind that when a minus sign precedes a parenthesized expression, then the sign must be distributed to each term when the parentheses are removed:
	- ${-(b + c) = -b - c.}$
	- ${-(-b + c) = b - c.}$
	- ${-(b - c) = -b + c.}$
	- ${-(-b - c) = b + c.}$
	- ${-(-b + (-c)) = -(-b - c) = b + c.}$

### Multiplying Polynomials
- The product of polynomials is obtained through a repeated application of the distributive property.
	$$
		\begin{aligned}
			(a + b)(c + d) &= a(c + d) + b(c + d) \\
			&= ac + ad + bc + bd
		\end{aligned}
	$$

### Product Formulas
_The following formulas are heavily used in manipulating polynomials_.
- Let ${s}$ and ${t}$ be algebraic expressions. Then:
	1. ${(s + t)(s - t) = s^2 - t^2.}$
	2. ${(s + t)^2 = s^2 + 2st + t^2.}$
	3. ${(s - t)^2 = s^2 - 2st + t^2.}$
	4. ${(s + t)^3 = s^3 + 3s^2 t + 3st^2 + t^3.}$
	5. ${(s - t)^3 = s^3 - 3 s^2 t + 3 s t^2 - t^3.}$
	
### Factoring
- The distributive property _expands_ polynomials. To reverse this process, we _factor_ the polynomial.
	- ~example.~ ${x^2 - 9 = (x - 3)(x + 3).}$
	- Here, we say that ${x - 3}$ and ${x + 3}$ are _factors_ of ${x^2 - 9.}$
- There are many ways to factor polynomials.

#### Factoring Common Factors 
- The most straightforward approach is to _factor out_ common factors.
	- ~example~. ${(3x^2) - 6x = 3x(x - 2).}$
	- ~example~. ${8x^4y^2 + 6x^3 y^3 - 2xy^4.}$
		$$
			\begin{aligned}
				8x^4y^2 + 6x^3 y^3 - 2xy^4 &= (2xy^2)(4x^3) + (2xy^2)(3x^2y) + (2xy^2)(-y^2)  \\
				&= 2xy^2(4x^3 + 3x^2y - y^2).
			\end{aligned}
		$$

#### Factoring Trinomials
- A common form of polynomials is the trinomial ${x^2 + bx + c.}$
- We know that ${(x + r)(x + s) = x^2 + (r + s)x + rs.}$
- Hence, we need numbers ${r}$ and ${s}$ such that ${r + s = b}$ and ${r \cdot s = c.}$
- To factorize a trinomial of the form ${ax^2 + bx + c}$ with ${a \neq 1,}$ we require factors of the form ${px + r}$ and ${qx + s,}$ such that:
	$$
		ax^2 + bx + c = (px + r)(qx + s) = pqx^2 + (ps + qr)x + rs.
	$$ 
	- We may do so by brute force; find the numbers ${p,}$ ${q,}$ ${r,}$ and ${s}$ such that:
		- ${pq = a,}$
		- ${rs = c,}$ and
		- ${ps + qr = b.}$

~examples.~
- ${6x^2 + 7x - 5 = (3x + 5)(2x - 1).}$
- ${x^2 - 2x - 3 = (x - 3)(x + 1).}$
- Remember that expressions can be substituted with variables. When we see large, common expressions, it’s helpful to reduce all of them to a single variable. Consider ${(5a + 1)^2 - 2(5a + 1) - 3.}$
	- This has the form ${u^2 - 2 u - 3,}$ where ${u = 5a + 1.}$
	- From the previous example, we know the expression ${u^2 - 2 u - 3}$ can be factored into ${(u - 3)(u + 1).}$ 
	- Thus, substituting for ${u,}$ we have ${((5a + 1) - 3)((5a + 1) + 1).}$
	- Which reduces to ${(5a - 2)(5a + 2).}$

#### Common Factoring Patterns 
- ${a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b).}$
- ${a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2.}$
- ${a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = (a - b)^2.}$
- ${a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2).}$
- ${a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a^2 - ab + b^2).}$

## Rational Expressions
- A _rational expression_ is an expression of the form ${A/B,}$ where ${A}$ and ${B}$ are polynomials and ${B \neq 0.}$

### Domains of Rational Expressions
- The definition of a rational expression imposes a necessary condition: ${B \neq 0.}$ That is, the denominator _cannot_ be zero. Thus, whenever we work with rational expressions, the first step is to always look at relevant variables: What values _cannot_ be used to substitute the variables? I.e., we must find the rational expression’s domain.
:::

:::section
~examples.~
1. ${\dfrac{x}{x^2 - 5x + 6}.}$
	- Equate the denominator to zero and solve for ${x.}$ By factoring: ${(x-2)(x-3)=0.}$ We see that ${x}$ cannot be ${2}$ or ${3,}$ since ${x = 2}$ and ${x=3}$ would result in a zero denominator.
2. ${\dfrac{\sqrt{x}}{x-5}.}$ 
	- This is a good example of watching for _all_ the relevant variables. Clearly, ${x}$ cannot be ${5.}$ But ${x}$ must also be greater than or equal to ${0}$ by the definition of a square root.

### Simplifying Rational Expressions
- To simplify rational expressions, we factor both the numerator and the denominator with the following property:
	$$
		\dfrac{AC}{BC} = \dfrac{A}{B}.
	$$	
	- ~example.~ ${\dfrac{x^2-1}{x^2 + x - 2} = \dfrac{(x-1)(x+1)}{(x-1)(x+2)} = \dfrac{x+1}{x+2}.}$

### Multiplying Rational Expressions 
- When multiplying rational expressions, the following property applies:
	$$
		\dfrac{A}{B} \cdot \dfrac{C}{D} = \dfrac{AC}{BD}.
	$$ 

:::example
$$
	\begin{aligned}
		& \dfrac{x^2 + 2x - 3}{x^2 + 8x + 16} \cdot \dfrac{3x + 12}{x-1} \\
		&= \dfrac{(x-1)(x+3)}{(x+4)(x+4)} \cdot \dfrac{3(x+4)}{x-1} \\
		&= \dfrac{3(x-1)(x+3)(x+4)}{(x-1)(x+4)(x+4)} \\
		&= \dfrac{3(x + 3)}{x+4}
	\end{aligned}
$$
:::

### Dividing Rational Expressions
- To divide rational expressions, we rely on the following property:
	$$
		\dfrac{\dfrac{A}{B}}{\dfrac{C}{D}} = \dfrac{A \cdot D}{B \cdot C} = \dfrac{AD}{BC}.
	$$
	
:::example
$$
	\begin{aligned}
		& \dfrac{ \dfrac{x-4}{x^2 - 4} }{ \dfrac{x^2-3x-4}{x^2+5x+6} } \\
		&= \dfrac{x-4}{x^2-4} \cdot \dfrac{x^2+5x+6}{x^2-3x-4} \\
		&= \dfrac{x-4}{(x-2)(x+2)} \cdot \dfrac{(x+2)(x+3)}{(x-4)(x+1)} \\
		&= \dfrac{(x-4)(x+2)(x+3)}{(x-2)(x+2)(x-4)(x+1)} \\
		&= \dfrac{x+3}{(x-2)(x+1)}
	\end{aligned}
$$
:::

### Adding Rational Expressions
- To add or subtract rational expressions, we first find a common denominator, then apply the following property:
	$$
		\dfrac{A}{C} + \dfrac{B}{C} = \dfrac{A+B}{C}.
	$$
