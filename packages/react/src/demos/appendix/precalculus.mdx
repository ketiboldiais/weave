# Precalculus

This section provides a review of basic algebra and trigonometry (what might be called “precalculus” in U.S. curricula).

## Numbers
In mathematics, we classify numbers with the following hierarchy.


## Rational Arithmetic
:::definition
__Addition over ${\mathbb{Q}}$.__ Given the rational number ${a/b}$ and the rational number ${c/d,}$ it follows that:

$$
	\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad}{bd} + \frac{bc}{bd} = \frac{ad + bc}{bd}.
$$
:::

_Example._ ${\dfrac{3}{2} + \dfrac{5}{7} = \dfrac{3 \cdot 7}{2 \cdot 7} + \dfrac{5 \cdot 2}{2 \cdot 7} = \dfrac{10}{14}.}$



:::definition
__Multiplication over ${\mathbb{Q}}$.__ Given the rational number ${a/b}$ and the rational number ${c/d,}$ it follows that:

$$
	\frac{a}{b} \cdot \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ac}{bd}.
$$
:::


Given that subtraction is merely syntactic sugar for addition on the additive inverse of the second operand, we may define subtraction from a combination of the addition and multiplication definitions:

:::definition
__Subtraction over ${\mathbb{Q}}$.__ Given the rational number ${a/b}$ and the rational number ${c/d,}$ it follows that:

$$
	\frac{a}{b} - \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad}{bd} + \left(\frac{-1}{1} \cdot \frac{bc}{bd}\right) = \frac{ad - bc}{bd}.
$$
:::

## Real Arithmetic
The following properties hold for the set of all real numbers, ${\reals.}$

:::definition
__Properties of ${\mathbb{R}.}$__ Let ${x,}$ ${y,}$ and ${z}$ be real numbers.

- __Closure of Addition.__ The sum ${x + y}$ is always a real number.
- __Associativity of Addition.__ The grouping of summands is inconsequential: ${(x + y) + z = x + (y + z).}$
- __Commutativity of Addition.__ The ordering of summands is inconsequential: ${x + y = y + x.}$
- __Existence of Additive Identity.__ There exists an additive identity, ${0,}$ such that, for all ${x \in \mathbb{R}}$ ${0 + x = x + 0 = x.}$
- __Existence of Additive Inverse.__ For every ${x \in \reals,}$ there exists a unique real number ${-x,}$ such that ${x + (-x) = (-x) + x = 0,}$ and ${-x}$ is the only element in ${\mathbb{R}}$ with this property.
- __Closure of Multiplication.__ The product ${x \cdot y}$ is always a real number.
- __Associativity of Multiplication.__ The grouping of multiplicands is inconsequential: ${(x \cdot y) \cdot z = x \cdot (y \cdot z).}$
- __Commutativity of Multiplication.__ The ordering of multiplicands is inconsequential:  ${x \cdot y = y \cdot x.}$
- __Existence of Multiplicative Identity.__ There exists a multiplicative identity, ${1,}$ such that for all ${x \in \reals,}$ ${1 \cdot x = x \cdot 1 = x.}$
- __Existence of Multiplicative Inverse.__ For each ${x \in \reals}$ with ${x \neq 0,}$ there exists a unique real number ${x^{-1}}$ such that ${x^{-1} \cdot x = 1,}$ and ${x^{-1}}$ is the only element in ${\mathbb{R}}$ relative to ${x}$ with this property.
- __Distributivity.__ ${x \cdot (y + z) = xy + xz}$ and ${(x + y) \cdot z = xz + yz.}$
:::

We take subtraction and division as the following definitions:

:::definition
__Subtraction.__ For all real numbers ${a}$ and ${b,}$ the operation of subtraction is defined as:

$$
	a - b = a + (-b).
$$
:::

:::definition
__Division.__ For all real numbers ${a}$ and ${b,}$ the operation of division is defined as:

$$
	a \div b = a \cdot b^{-1}, ~~~~ b \neq 0.
$$
:::

The following properties are often useful when manipulating algebraic expressions.

:::definition
__Properties of Negatives.__ For all real numbers ${a}$ and ${b:}$

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		&-(-a) = a~; \\[1em]
		&-ab = -(ab) = a(-b) = -ab~; \\[1em]
		&(-a)(-b) = ab~; \\[1em]
		&-1(a) = (-1)a = -a~; \\[1em]
		&\dfrac{-a}{b} = -\dfrac{a}{b} = \dfrac{a}{-b}, ~~~ b \neq 0~; \\[1em]
		&\dfrac{-a}{-b} = -\dfrac{-a}{b} = -\dfrac{a}{-b} = \dfrac{a}{b}, ~~~ b \neq 0. \\[1em]
	\end{aligned}
$$
:::

:::definition
__Properties of Zero.__ For all real numbers ${a}$ and ${b:}$

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		& a \cdot 0 = 0 \cdot a = 0 ~; \\[1em]
		& ab = 0 \iff (a \neq 0 ~\text{ or }~ b \neq 0).
	\end{aligned}
$$
:::

## Exponents
The exponent is syntactic sugar for repeated multiplication. That is, given ${a \in \mathbb{R},}$

$$
	a^k = a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot a_{k-1} \cdot a_k,
$$

where each ${a_i = a.}$ For example, ${a^2 = a \cdot a,}$ ${a^3 = a \cdot a \cdot a,}$ etc.

:::definition
__Definition.__ Let ${n}$ be a positive integer and ${x}$ a real number. Then the following properties hold:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		& a^n = a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot \ldots \cdot a_{n-1} \cdot a_n ~, \\[1em]
		& a^{-n} = \dfrac{1}{a^n} ~, \\[1em]
		& a^0 = 1 ~, \\[1em]
		& a^m a^n = a^{m+n} ~, \\[1em]
		& (a^n)^m = a^{mn} ~, \\[1em]
		& (ab)^n = a^{n}b^{n} ~, \\[1em]
		& \left( \dfrac{a}{b} \right)^n = \dfrac{a^n}{b^n}~, \\[1em]
		& \dfrac{a^m}{a^n} = \begin{cases}
			a^{m-n} \\[1em]
			\dfrac{1}{a^{n-m}}
		\end{cases}, ~~~ a \neq 0.
	\end{aligned}
$$
:::

_Example_. ${(3a^5)(2a^{-3}) = (3 \cdot 6)(a^5a^{-3}) = 6a^2.}$

_Example_. ${\dfrac{6x^{-2}}{8x^{-5}} = \dfrac{3x^{-2}-(-5)}{4} = \dfrac{3x^3}{4}.}$

_Example_. ${-4y^3 - (-4y)^3 = -4y^3 - ((-4)^3 \cdot y^3) = -4y^3 - (-64y^3) = 60y^3.}$

### Scientific Notation
For computationally intensive problems, we’ll often find ourselves working with colossal or miniscule numbers. Because writing these numbers out is tiresome, we use _scientific notation_ instead.

:::definition
__Definition.__ For any positive real number ${x,}$ we can express ${x}$ in the form:

$$
	r = a \times 10^n ~~~~ 1 \leq a \lt 10,~~n \in \mathbb{Z.}
$$
:::

_Example._ ${6~430 = 6.43 \times 10^3.}$

_Example._ ${0.00000007 = 7\times 10^{-8}.}$

## Radicals

:::definition
__Definition.__ Let ${n}$ be a natural number, and let ${a}$ and ${b}$ be real numbers. Then ${a}$ is the _${n^{\text{th}}}$ root_ of ${b}$ if ${a^n = b,}$ and we write:

$$
	b^{1/n} = \sqrt[n]{b} = a.
$$
:::

_Example._ ${27^{1/3} = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3,}$ given that ${3^3 = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 27.}$

:::definition
__Theorem.__ Let ${n}$ be a natural number and let ${b}$ be a real number.

1. Suppose ${b \gt 0.}$ Then:
	1. if ${n}$ is even, then ${b}$ has two real ${n^{\text{th}}}$ roots, each the negative of the other;
	2. if ${n}$ is odd, then ${b}$ has one real ${n^{\text{th}}}$ root.
2. If ${b = 0,}$ then ${b}$ has only one real ${n^{\text{th}}}$ root, ${0.}$
3. Suppose ${b \lt 0.}$ Then:
	1. if ${n}$ is even, then ${b}$ has no real ${n^{\text{th}}}$ root.
	2. if ${n}$ is odd, then ${b}$ has on real ${n^{\text{th}}}$ root.
:::

_Example._ ${16^{1/4} = \sqrt[4]{16} = (-2, 2),}$ given that ${2^4 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 16}$ and ${(-2)^4 = -2 \cdot -2 \cdot -2 \cdot -2 = 16.}$

When working with radicals, we’re often only concerned with the _principal ${n^{\text{th}}}$ root_, as defined below.

:::definition
__Definition.__ Where ${n}$ is a natural number and ${b}$ is a real number, the _principal ${n^{\text{th}}}$ root of ${b}$_, denoted ${b^{1/n}}$ or ${\sqrt[n]{b},}$ is:

1. the real ${n^{\text{th}}}$ root of ${b}$ if there is only one real ${n^{\text{th}}}$ root,
2. the positive ${n^{\text{th}}}$ root of ${b}$ if there are two real ${n^{\text{th}}}$ roots, or
3. _undefined_ if ${b}$ has no real ${n^{\text{th}}}$ root.
:::

:::dfn
__Properties of Radicals.__ Let ${m}$ and ${n}$ be natural numbers and let ${b}$ be any real number. Provided ${b}$ is nonnegative whenever ${n}$ is even:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		& b^{m/n} = (b^{1/n})^m~, \\[1em]
		& b^{-m/n} = \dfrac{1}{b^{m/n}}~, \\[1em]
		& \left(b^{1/n}\right)^{m} = \left( b^m \right)^{1/n}~, \\[1em]
		& \left( \sqrt[n]{b} \right)^m = \sqrt[n]{b^m}~, \\[1em]
		& \sqrt[n]{x^n} = x~, \\[1em]
		& \sqrt[n]{xy} = \sqrt[n]{x}\sqrt[n]{y}~, \\[1em]
		& \sqrt[n]{\dfrac{x}{y}} = \dfrac{\sqrt[n]{x}}{\sqrt[n]{y}}~. \\[1em]
	\end{aligned}
$$
:::

By convention, we say that a radial expression is in _simplified form_ if all of the following conditions are met:

1. No radicand (the expression within the radical sign) contains a factor to a power greater than or equal to the radical’s index.
	- _Example._ ${\sqrt{x^5}}$ violates this condition, since its index is ${2}$ and its radicand contains a factor raised to ${5.}$
2. No power of the radicand and the index have a common factor, other than 1. 
	- _Example._ ${\sqrt[8]{x^4}}$ violates this condition, since the radicand and the index have multiple common factors other than ${1:}$ the integer ${2}$ and ${4.}$
3. If the expression is a rational expression, then no radical appears in the denominator.
	- _Example._ ${{1}/{\sqrt{x}}}$ violates this condition.
4. No rational expression appears within a radical.
	- _Example._ ${\sqrt{1/3}}$ and ${\sqrt{x/y}}$ both violate this condition.
	
## Polynomials
Algebraic expressions that involve only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and raising to natural number powers are called _polynomials_. Polynomials are particularly special because they avoid all of the complexities associated with roots, logarithms, and other elaborate operations.

:::definition
__Definition.__ A polynomial ${p}$ in a single variable ${x}$ is an expression of the form:

$$
	p = p_nx^n + p_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + p_1x + p_0,
$$

where each ${p_i}$ is called a _term_, the _coefficients_ of ${p_i}$ are rational numbers, and ${n}$ is a non-negative integer. If ${p_n \neq 0,}$ then ${p_n}$ is called the _leading coefficient_ of ${p}$ and ${n}$ the _degree_ of ${p.}$ The expression ${p = 0}$ is called the _zero polynomial_ – it has the leading coefficient ${0}$ and, by convenion, has the degree ${-\infty.}$ We denote the leading coefficient of a polynomial ${p}$ with the notation:

$$
	\text{lc}(p),
$$

and the the degree of ${p}$ with the notation:

$$
	\text{deg}(p).
$$
:::

Alongside this definition, we special names for certain kinds of polynomials. A _monomial_ is a polynomial with a single term (e.g., ${3x}$ or ${5y^2}$). A _binomial_ is a polynomial with two terms (e.g., ${x^3 - x^2}$ or ${x + 1}$). And a _trinomial_ is a polynomial with three terms (e.g., ${x^5 + \frac{1}{2}x - 2.}$).

Two terms in a polynomial are called _like terms_ if they have the same variables raised to the same powers (although they may have different coefficients). For example, ${3x^3}$ and ${17x^3}$ are like terms. If a polynomial contains two or more like terms, we may combine them into a single term.

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		5x^3y - 2xy - x^3y - 2x^3y &= 5x^3y - x^3y - 2x^3y - 2xy \\[1em]
		&= (5x^3y - x^3y - 2x^3y) - 2xy \\[1em]
		&= (5 - 1 - 2)x^3y - 2xy \\[1em]
		&= 2x^3y - 2xy.
	\end{aligned}
$$

### Adding & Subtracting Polynomials

Adding and subtracting polynomials amounts to combining like terms.

_Example._

$$
\begin{aligned}
	& (x^4 - 3x^3 + x^2) + (-x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x) + (3x^2 - 4x - 5) \\[1em]
	&= x^4 - 3x^3 + x^2 - x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x + 3x^2 - 4x - 5 \\[1em]
	&= x^4 - 4x^3 + 2x^2 - x - 5.
\end{aligned}
$$

We may also perform the operation with a vertical layout:

$$
\begin{matrix}
	  & x^4 & - & 3x^3 & + & x^2  &   &    &   & \\
	  &     & - &  x^3 & - & 2x^2 & + & 3x &   & \\
	+ & 		&   &      &   & 3x^2 & - & 4x & - & 5 \\
	\hline
	  & x^4 & - & 4x^3 & + & 2x^2 & - &  x & - & 5.
\end{matrix}
$$

### Multiplying Polynomials
Multiplication of polynomials amounts to applying the distributive property.

_Example._

$$
\begin{aligned}
	& (2x - 3)(3x^2 - 2x + 3) \\[1em]
	&= 2x(3x^2 - 2x + 3) - 3(3x^2 - 2x + 3) \\[1em]
	&= 6x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 9x^2 + 6x - 9 \\[1em]
	&= 6x^3 - 13x^2 + 12x - 9.
\end{aligned}
$$

### Factoring 
A _factor_ of a number ${n}$ is one of two more numbers that, when multiplied, yields ${n.}$ We extend this to algebraic expressions: A factor of an algebraic expression ${u}$ is one of two or more algebraic expressions that, when multiplied, yields ${u.}$ The act of finding such factors – numeric or expressive – is called _factoring_.

_Example._ ${x^2 - 4 = (x - 2)(x + 2).}$ Here, ${x - 2}$ and ${x + 2}$ are factors of ${x^2 - 4.}$

Factorization is of vital importance in mathematics – it allows us to view expressions in many different ways. For example, the integer ${20}$ can be rewritten as:

$$
	5 \cdot 4, \\[1em]
	2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5,  \\[1em]
	(1/2)(10)(4).
$$

Similarly, the expression

$$
	2x^2 - x - 6
$$

may be viewed as any of the following:

$$
	(2x + 3)(x - 2), \\[1em]
	2\left( x^2 - \dfrac{x}{2} - 3 \right), \\[1em]
	2 \left( x + \dfrac{3}{2} \right)(x - 2).
$$

Recall that an integer ${n}$ is _prime_ if its only positive integer factors are ${1}$ and itself. For example, ${2}$ is prime, since the only positive integer factors of ${2}$ are ${2}$ and ${1.}$ An integer greater than ${1}$ that is not prime is called a _composite number_. The integer ${1}$ is neither prime nor composite. If a composite number ${k}$ is represented entirely as a product of prime factors, then we say that ${k}$ is _factored completely_. This discussion leads to a particularly important property of the integers.

:::dfn
__Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.__ Every positive integer greater than ${1}$ is either:
1. prime, or
2. a unique:sup[*] product of primes.

:sup[*] _Except possibly for the order of the factors._
:::

_Example._ ${20 = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5 = 5 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 2.}$

:::definition
__Prime Polynomial.__ Let ${p}$ be a polynomial. We say that ${p}$ is _prime_ if it cannot be expressed in the form ${p = u \cdot v,}$ where ${u}$ and ${v}$ are polynomials, both with a degree of at least ${2.}$
:::

### Factoring Approaches
The simplest factoring approach is _factoring out common factors_:

$$
\begin{aligned}
	& 2x^3y - 8x^2y^2 - 6xy^3 \\[1em]
	&= (2xy)x^2 - (2xy)4xy - (2xy)3y^2 \\[1em]
	&= 2xy(x^2 - 4xy - 3y^2).
\end{aligned}
$$

### Factoring by Grouping
Consider the polynomial ${3x^2 - 6x + 4x - 8.}$ We start by grouping the first two and last two terms:

$$
	\begin{aligned}
		& 3x^2 - 6x + 4x - 8 \\[1em]
		& = (3x^2 - 6x) + (4x - 8) \\[1em]
		& = 3x(x - 2) + 4(x - 2) \\[1em]
		& = (3x + 4)(x - 2). 
	\end{aligned}
$$

### Factoring Formulas
Some expression forms are so common that it’s worth remembering the patterns behind their factorings:

| Pattern               | Factoring                               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Perfect Square        | ${u^2 + 2uv + v^2 = (u + v)^2}$         |
|                       | ${u^2 - 2uv + v^2 = (u - v^2)}$         |
| Difference of Squares | ${u^2 - v^2 = (u - v)(u + v)}$          |
| Difference of Cubes   | ${u^3 - v^3 = (u - v)(u^2 + uv + v^2)}$ |
| Sum of Cubes          | ${u^3 + v^3 = (u + v)(u^2 - uv + v^2)}$ |

## Rational Expressions
:::dfn
__Definition.__ Let ${v}$ and ${w}$ be algebraic expressions. Then an expression of the form ${v/w}$ with ${w \neq 0}$ is called a _fractional expression_. If ${v}$ and ${w}$ are polynomials, then ${v/w}$ is called a _rational expression_.
:::

_Example._ ${\dfrac{x-2}{2x^2 - 3x + 1}.}$

_Example._ ${3/x.}$

_Example._ ${\dfrac{x^2 + 3x - 5}{1}.}$

_Example._ ${\frac{1}{2} \cdot x^2.}$

:::dfn
__Fundamental Property of Fractions.__ Let ${a,}$ ${b,}$ and ${k}$ be real numbers with ${b \neq 0}$ and ${k \neq 0.}$ Then

$$
	\dfrac{ka}{kb} = \dfrac{a}{b}.
$$
:::

The same rules for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing rational numbers apply to rational expressions.
