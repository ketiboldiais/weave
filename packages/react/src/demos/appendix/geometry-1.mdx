# Elementary Geometry

## Terminology
The word _geometry_ comprises two Greek roots: _geo_ (of _earth_) and _metry_ (of _measurement_). The simplest entity in geometry is a _point_.

:::definition
__Point.__ A point is a position.

Points are primitive concepts. They have no physicality (i.e., thereâ€™s no notion of length, width, or thickness). From two points, we may draw a _line segment_:
