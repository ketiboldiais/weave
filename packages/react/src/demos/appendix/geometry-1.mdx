# Elementary Geometry

## Terminology
The word _geometry_ comprises two Greek roots: _geo_ (of _earth_) and _metry_ (of _measurement_). The simplest entity in geometry is a _point_. A point is nothing more than a position – primitive concepts with no physicality (i.e., there’s no notion of length, width, or thickness). From two points, we may draw a _line segment_:

import {LineSegment1} from './geometry-1.figs.tsx'

<LineSegment1/>

By convention, we use uppercase Latin letters to denote points. To denote a line segment (say, the line segment between ${A}$ and ${B,}$) we write ${\overline{AB}.}$ Given a single point, we may draw a line extending infinitely in some direction, passing through some other point:

import {Ray1} from './geometry-1.figs.tsx';

<Ray1/>

Above, the point ${A}$ is called the _vertex_ of the ray ${\overrightarrow{AB}}$ (notice the usage of an overlined right-arrow to denote a ray). A path that passes through two or more points – running infinitely – is called a _line_.

import {Line1} from './geometry-1.figs.tsx';

<Line1/>

Points that lie on the same line are said to be _collinear_. Above, the distance from ${A}$ to ${B}$ and the distance from ${B}$ to ${C}$ are equal (we will construct a proof later). From this property, we say that ${A}$ and ${C}$ are _equidistant_ with respect to ${B.}$

Line segments, rays, and lines are _1-dimensional constructs_. We can only travel in one directions: forward or backward (or left or right, depending on context – these are informal, subjective terms). There are, of course, _2-dimensional constructs_. In the previous examples, we used a _plane_ for context (indicated by the axis lines). With a _2-dimensional construct_, we may travel in two directions: north or south, _and_ east or west. 1-dimensional constructs that lie on the same plane are said to be _coplanar._ Similarly, with 3-dimensional contracts, we have three directions: left or right, _and_ up or down, _and_ in or out.
