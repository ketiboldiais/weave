# Algebra

An _algebra_ is a set ${S}$ with an _operation_ ${\star}$ that maps one or more elements of ${S}$ to another element of ${S.}$ For example, suppose if ${S = \set{0,1},}$ then multiplication is an operation on ${S:}$

- ${1 \cdot 0 = 0,}$
- ${0 \cdot 1 = 0,}$
- ${1 \cdot 1 = 1,}$
- ${0 \cdot 0 = 0.}$

Addition, however, is not, since ${2}$ is not an element of ${S:}$

- ${1 + 0 = 1,}$
- ${0 + 1 = 1,}$
- ${1 + 1 = 2,}$
- ${0 + 0 = 0.}$
