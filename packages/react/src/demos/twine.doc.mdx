# Twine
Twine is a scripting language designed specifically for _Loom_. The language supports variable and function declarations, symbolic computation, array-based computation, and classical object-oriented programming.

## Comments
Single-line comments in Twine start with three hyphens-minus (`“-”`) and terminate on the first newline (the character `“\n”`):


<Terminal source={`
--- Single-line comments emphasize intermissions.
`} height={60}/>

Multiline comments start with at least three equals signs (`“=”`) and terminate on at least three equals signs:


<Terminal source={`
============================
Following Twine’s emphasis
on readability, we use
multiple “=” signs to call
the reader’s attention.
============================
`} height={190}/>

## First Program
Nodding to tradition, here is our first program in Twine. Clicking the “Run” button, we should see `“Hello, world!”`, followed by an `OK`, beneath the block.
 
<Terminal source={`print "Hello, world!";`} height={60}/>

The keyword `print` is a built-in operator in Twine for logging. Try entering something else between the double quotes.

## Basic Arithmetic
Twine recognizes a variety of arithmetic operations:

<Terminal source={`
print 1 + 2;
print 3 - 5;
print 5 / 2;
print 5 div 2;
print 2^3;
print 4 rem 2;
print 4 % 10;
`} height={"210px"}/>

Twine calls these _algebraic infix operators_, defined as follows:

:::definition
__Algebraic Infix Operators.__ Where `a` and `b` are numbers:

| Expression | Semantic                                                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `a + b`    | The sum of `a` and `b`                                              |
| `a - b`    | The difference of `a` and `b`                                       |
| `a * b`    | The product of `a` and `b`                                          |
| `a / b`    | The division of `a` by `b`                                          |
| `a div b`  | The quotient of `a` and `b` (equivalent to ${\lfloor a/b \rfloor}$) |
| `a^b`      | `a` raised to `b`                                                   |
| `a mod b`  | The _remainder_ of `a` and `b`                                        |
| `a rem b`  | The _signed remainder_ of `a` and `b`                               |
| `a % b`    | `a%` of `b`                                                         |
:::

Note the emphasis on _remainder_ and _signed remainder_. Twine recognizes two different forms of remainder: `rem` for the “C-style” remainder (the `%` operator in JavaScript) and `mod` for the more mathematical definition. The key difference between these two operators is that `mod` always reduces to a positive integer.

## Fraction Arithmetic
The arithmetic operators above can apply over ${\mathbb{Q}}$ (i.e., fraction arithmetic). Fractions are written with the syntax `a|b`, where `a` and `b` are integers.


<Terminal source={`
print 1|2 + 2|3;
print 1|3 - 3|8;
print 12|17 * 1|4;
`} height={110}/>

## Comparisons
Twine’s comparison operators always reduce to the Booleans true or false. Equality is checked with the double-equals `==` operator.

<Terminal source={`
print 1 < 2;
print 2 > 5;
print 3 <= 4;
print 8 >= 9;
print 8 == 8;
`} height={160}/>

## Variables
Variables are declared with either the _let_ or _var_ keywords. Variables declared with _let_ are immutable – once declared, they are frozen in place, and we may not assign them a new value. Variables declared with _var_, however, are mutable.

For example, this is permissible:

<Terminal source={`
var y = 12;
y = 11;
`}/>

However, this will trigger an environment error, since `y` is immutable:

<Terminal source={`
let y = 3.14;
y = 5;
`}/>

Following the C tradition, statements are delimited by semicolons.


### Valid Identifiers
A lexeme will be interpreted as a variable name only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

1. The lexeme starts with an ASCII Latin character (lower- or upper-case), the underscore character (`“_”`) or a dollar sign (`“$”`).
2. The lexeme ends with an ASCII Latin character (lower- or upper-case), an ASCII digit (the Hindu-Arabic numerals `“0”` through `“9”`), an underscore character (`“_”`), or a dollar sign (`“$”`).
3. The lexeme is not a reserved word.

## Types
Twine recognizes the following core types by default. These types are outlined below, with their documentation symbols parenthesized:

:::hstack
- :u[__Nonalgebraics__]
- string ${\mathbb{S}}$
- boolean ${\mathbb{B}}$
- null ${\texttt{NULL}}$
---
- :u[__Numerics__]
- int ${\mathbb{Z}}$
- float ${\mathbb{F}}$
- rational ${\mathbb{Q}}$
- big-integer ${\mathbb{Z}^{\uparrow}}$
- big-rational ${\mathbb{Q}^{\uparrow}}$
---
- :u[__Functionals__]
- function
- expression
---
- :u[__Gatherings__]
- set
- map
- object
---
- :u[__Sequentials__]
- tuple
- list
- vector
- matrix
- sequence
:::

Each type belongs to a _family_, marked above in bold, underlined headings. Before discussing these families, we must present an overview of each individual type.

### Strings
Strings in Twine are always delimited by double quotes:
~~~ts
let city = "Oconomowoc";
~~~

### Booleans
The set of all Booleans comprises two values, _true_ and _false_:

~~~ts
let aye = true;
let nay = false;
~~~

### Null
The value _null_ denotes nothing, or empty. In contrast to some procedural languages, Twine has no notion of a _void function_. All semantics reduce to some atomic type, _null_ or otherwise.

~~~ts
let empty = null;
~~~

### Numerics
Twine has several numeric types: _int_, _float_, _fraction_, _real_, _rational_, and _complex_.

### Sequentials
_Sequentials_ are well-ordered collections of data. Twine’s core sequential types include _vector_, _matrix_, and _tuple_.

A vector `v`:

~~~ts
let v = [1,2,3,4];
~~~

A matrix `M`:

~~~ts
let M = [
  [1,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,1],
]
~~~

A tuple `t`:
~~~ts
let t = (1,2,3,4)
~~~

### Indexing
All sequentials can be accessed via an _indexing expression_:

<Terminal source={`let x = [8,9,1,2];
let element = x[1];
print element;`} height={110}/>

Following mathematical convention, Twine uses 1-based indexing. That is, the first element of a sequential has an index of 1, the second element 2, the third 3, ${\ldots,}$ the ${n^{\text{th}}}$ element ${n.}$

In contrast to JavaScript, Twine does not allow indices exceeding the length of a given sequential. Thus, indexing into an array with a value beyond that of the array’s length will return an error:

<Terminal source={`let x = [8,9,1,2];
let element = x[5];
print element;`} height={110}/>

### Vectors
Vectors in Twine are sequences of strictly _ints_ or _floats_. Inserting or initializing any other type into a vector will return a type error. For fixed-length, homogenous sequences of other data types, we use _tuples_. For mixed sequences of arbitrary length, we use _lists_. 

:::aside
The policy of restricting vectors to only integers or floating point numbers stems from how heavily used vectors and matrices are in Loom. Under Twine’s current architecture, vectors are the building blocks of matrices, and operations over matrices, in general, are computationally intensive. They can take significant time and memory to perform. Allowing non-homogenous, arbitrary length vectors requires many more checks at runtime, yielding an increased risk of poor performance. 
:::

Vectors are initialized with square brackets:

<Terminal source={`let x = [1,2,3,4];
print x;`}/>

## Branching Statements
Twine provides the standard `if-else` construct for branching:

<Terminal source={`
var x = 5;
if x < 10 {
  x = 4;
} else {
  x = 8;
}
print x;
`} height={"210px"}/>

Like Rust and other modern languages, the if-block’s necessary condition need not be surrounded by parentheses. However, a left-brace is required to demarcate the consequent’s start. The else branch doesn’t require braces, but it’s best to do so for readability.

## Loops
Twine provides two iterative constructs, for-loops and while-loops (note that the compiler used for this page has a safety cap of 600 iterations):


<Terminal source={`
var k = 1;
var n = 0;
while (k < 10) {
  n += k;
  k++;
}
print n;
k = 0;
for (var i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
  k += 2;
}
print k;
`} height={"330px"}/>

When working with loops, it’s important to remember that variables declared with `let` are immutable by default.


## Functions
Functions are declared with the `fn` keyword, followed by an identifier, and a parenthesized argument list. If the function’s body comprises a single statement, then the assignment operator (`=`) may follow the list. Otherwise, braces are required to indicate a block of statements:

<Terminal source={`fn f(x) = x^2;
print f(5);
fn g(x) {
  let k = 1/2;
  return x * k;
}
print g(6);`} height={"210px"}/>


## Classes
Twine supports classical object-oriented programming (OOP) via classes.[^classical-oop]

[^classical-oop]: By _classical_, we mean the approach taken by _Simula_, _Smalltalk_, and its descendants. _See_ [_**jeff sutherland**_, _A History of Object-Oriented Programming Languates and their Impact on Program Design and Software Development_ 2 (1999)](http://jeffsutherland.com/papers/Rans/OOlanguages.pdf).

<Terminal source={`
class Circle {
  callThyself() {
    print "circle!";
  }
}
let circle1 = Circle(5);
circle1.callThyself();
`} height={"210px"}/>

Syntactically, a class in _Twine_ is a collection of functions. Semantically, a class is a bundle of _properties_, where each property is mapped to by a unique _field_. Above, the `Circle` class comprises three fields – `def`, `diameter`, and `radius` – and two properties: (1) `def` maps to `null` (with the side-effect of defining properties bound to the `Circle` instance’s `this` reference), and (2) both `diameter` and `radius` map to numerics.

### `def` and `this`
Like other OOP languages, class instances in Twine have a _this_ reference:


<Terminal source={`
class Box {
  def(length, width, height) {
    this.length = length;
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
  }
  volume() {
    return this.length * this.width * this.height;
  }
}
let box1 = Box(3,5,2);
print box1.volume();
`} height={330}/>

Above, we see that the the `Box` class consists of three properties, `length`, `width`, and `height`. These properties are initialized with the `def` method (what might be called a _constructor_ in other OOP languages). All class instances in Twine have a `def` method for initializing their properties.
