# Graphics
This is the documentation page for the various graphics submodules comprising _Loom_.

## PathCommand
Loom operates by applying matrix transformations to SVG path commands. These commands are represented by the abstract data type _PathCommand_, the atomic data type for all graphics entities. There are eight subtypes of _PathCommand_:

| Type       | Maps to SVG Command            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| _MCommand_ | M (move-to).                   |
| _LCommand_ | L (line-to).                   |
| _HCommand_ | H (horizontal-line-to).        |
| _VCommand_ | V (vertical-line-to).          |
| _QCommand_ | Q (quadratic-bezier-curve-to). |
| _CCommand_ | Q (cubic-bezier-curve-to).     |
| _ACommand_ | A (arc-to).                    |
| _ZCommand_ | Z (close-path).                |

## MCommand
An `MCommand` corresponds to the SVG _move-to_ command. That is, “move the cursor to a given position.” To instantiate an `MCommand`, use the `M` function:

```ts
const m = M(1,1); // 'M1,1'
```

A third parameter may be passed to the `M` command, corresponding to the ${z}$-coordinate.

~~~ts
const m = M(1,1,1);
~~~

Since SVG commands only take two coordinates at most, the ${z}$-coordinate does not appear within the rendered path string; the coordinate is used purely for matrix transformations. In the demonstration below, the red point is positioned with a single _MCommand_. Dragging the sliders will adjust the ${x}$ and ${y}$ coordinates respectively.
