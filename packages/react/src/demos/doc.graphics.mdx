# Graphics
This is the documentation page for the various graphics submodules comprising _Loom_.

## Renderable
Data objects in _Loom_ all reduce to the data type _Renderable_. Internally, this is an object with a `_commands` property comprised of `PathCommands`. Each `PathCommand` corresponds to an SVG path command. To “draw” objects, _Loom_’s algorithms apply various matrix transformations to this array. The `PathCommand` subtypes are as follows:


| Type       | Maps to SVG Command            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| _MCommand_ | M (move-to).                   |
| _LCommand_ | L (line-to).                   |
| _HCommand_ | H (horizontal-line-to).        |
| _VCommand_ | V (vertical-line-to).          |
| _QCommand_ | Q (quadratic-bezier-curve-to). |
| _CCommand_ | Q (cubic-bezier-curve-to).     |
| _ACommand_ | A (arc-to).                    |
| _ZCommand_ | Z (close-path).                |


## _Renderable_.at(_x_, _y_) __this__
The `at` method on a renderable positions a renderable at the given ${x}$ and ${y}$ coordinates. For example, to position a `Circle` at the coordinate ${(1,1),}$ we write:

~~~ts
const p = circle().at(1,1)
~~~


To allow method chaining, the `at` method returns `this` (the callee’s reference – all the usual rules of the `this` keyword in JavaScript apply). Below, the red point is positioned via a call to its `at` method. Dragging the sliders will adjust the ${x}$ and ${y}$ arguments respectively.

## Circle
To render a `Circle`, we use the `circle` function.

~~~ts
const c = circle(5);
~~~

The `circle` function takes one argument, `r`, corresponding to the circle’s radius. Dragging the slider below will change circle’s radius argument accordingly.
