## PathCommands

Loom operates by applying matrix transformations to SVG path commands. These
commands are represented by the abstract data type _PathCommand_, the atomic
data type for all graphics entities. There are eight subtypes of _PathCommand_:

| Type       | Maps to SVG Command            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| _MCommand_ | M (move-to).                   |
| _LCommand_ | L (line-to).                   |
| _HCommand_ | H (horizontal-line-to).        |
| _VCommand_ | V (vertical-line-to).          |
| _QCommand_ | Q (quadratic-bezier-curve-to). |
| _CCommand_ | Q (cubic-bezier-curve-to).     |
| _ACommand_ | A (arc-to).                    |
| _ZCommand_ | Z (close-path).                |
