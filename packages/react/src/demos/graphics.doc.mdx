## PathCommands

Loom operates by applying matrix transformations to SVG path commands. These
commands are represented by the abstract data type _PathCommand_, the atomic
data type for all graphics entities. There are eight subtypes of _PathCommand_:

| Type       | Corresponding SVG Command              |

| _LCommand_ | L (line-to) command.                   |
| _HCommand_ | H (horizontal-line-to) command.        |
| _VCommand_ | V (vertical-line-to) command.          |
| _QCommand_ | Q (quadratic-bezier-curve-to) command. |
| _CCommand_ | Q (cubic-bezier-curve-to) command.     |
| _ACommand_ | A (arc-to) command.                    |
