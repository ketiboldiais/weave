# Set Theory

## Axioms
There are two versions of set theory: (1) __naive set theory__, and (2)
__axiomatic set theory__. We explore aspects of both theories in the
materials that follow. What are the differences? Naive set theory is the
version of set theory as originally constructed by the German mathematician
Georg Cantor.[^cantor_note] Axiomatic set theory is the version of set
theory constructed in response to several paradoxes, the most famous of
which is _Russell's Paradox_. In this chapter, we focus only on naive set
theory.

[^cantor_note]:
    When Cantor first introduced set theory, the math community largely
    ridiculed him. Over time, however, the theory gained big-name
    mathematicians like David Hilbert. Nevertheless, the ridicule remained
    and affected Cantor deeply. Comments at the time captured the split:
    David Hilbert famously said, "No one will drive us from the paradise
    which Cantor created for us." To which Wittgenstein&mdash;a philosopher
    and one of Hilbert's most formidable opponents&mdash;responded, "If one
    person can see it as a paradise of mathematicians, why should not
    another see it as a joke?"
